<p>It seems like just yesterday that we left the NICU at <a href="https://www.akronchildrens.org/For-Families-Patients.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital</a>. I have very many mixed memories of that place. Some of the scariest times of my life happened behind those walls and some of the happiest.</p>
<p>In the midst of a dark time we did our best to make the NICU home. Years ago I bought an art print that says, &#8220;Home is wherever I&#8217;m with you.&#8221; (Yes, it was bought from Urban Outfitters and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHEOF_rcND8&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros</a> were popular&#8230;ok now listening to them on repeat).</p>
<p>Since our marriage, Dustin and I have moved six times. It&#8217;s funny to add &#8220;NICU&#8221; to that list. We spent most nights there but spent 17 at <a href="http://rmhakron.org/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Ronald McDonald House</a> and once a week at home to rest up. I plan on writing a lot more about making the NICU home and our experiences there. In the meantime, enjoy this video I took near the end of our stay. You can tell Bella is much more stable and is even in an open cot!</p>
<p>XOXO</p>
