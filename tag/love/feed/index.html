If you&#8217;re checking this post out, chances are you&#8217;ve already seen some of my blog and want to know a little bit more about me and what I&#8217;m about. (Or where I began)</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;ve become a world-wide-web phenomenon and I&#8217;m working with Sephora and Taylor Swift is my bestie and calls me when her cats aren&#8217;t getting along.</p>
<p>Or&#8230; you may have just stumbled upon this itty bitty section of the internet by accident or by looking up information about T-swift&#8217;s <a href="http://www.etonline.com/news/2014/12/24121965/set_taylor_swift_coca_cola_640.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">cats</a>.</p>
<p>However you got here: I hope we can become fast friends and you&#8217;ll want to click around and stay awhile.</p>
<p><strong>Poeticlaughter is a blog dedicated to life and beauty through the lens of love.</strong></p>
<p>The journey to begin this blog is a long one with many attempts and failures. I remember when I lived in Chicago (in 2010) and worked in an office. I hated it. I lacked creativity and was sick of getting everyone&#8217;s mail everyday. Deep inside I knew I had <strong>more to offer the world</strong> and that I just needed the <strong>right push. </strong></p>
<p>A few years went by and we moved to Ohio. I began freelance writing and learned to have the confidence I needed to run an online business and express myself as a writer. Many different beauty blogs approached me and I wrote a lot about interior design, beauty, and travel. As I wrote, I realized I wanted to create <strong>something organic</strong>&#8230;something new that I wasn&#8217;t being monitored to write. It was through reading lots of different books about online business and flipping through many magazines that I realized:</p>
<p><strong>I have something unique to offer.</strong> There aren&#8217;t many beauty and lifestyle blogs that follow the latest trends but with an uplifting, empowering believers perspective.</p>
<p>So what does Poeticlaughter mean? It means that there is beauty and poetry in our life and laughter. It means that you can laugh at yourself and embrace your unique God-given talents in a way that doesn&#8217;t make others feel less-than. It means that whether you&#8217;re in your teens or are navigating retirement you can be beautiful inside and out while<strong> leaving your own mark on the world. </strong></p>
<p>On poeticlaughter.com I&#8217;ll be your guide, blogging about the latest in makeup, home decor, relationships and life! Although my primary focus will be on <strong>beauty</strong>, you may see glimpses of my personal life. I&#8217;m learning to love myself  well and the world around me one day at a time. Join me and learn a thing or two about lipstick, the latest in skincare, and if that hyped-up mascara is really worth $24.</p>
<p>Oh, and there may be a few posts about cats.</p>
