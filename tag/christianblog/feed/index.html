<p>It&#8217;s Saturday and Dustin is feeding Bella. I snuck away to write a few quick words on here!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so so happy to share these amazing family photographs with you. As I mentioned in my <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/27-weeker-micropreemie-photoshoot/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">blog post before</a>, having photos done in the NICU was amazing and special&#8230;but I dreamed of family photos outside of the hospital walls! Oh&#8230;and having Bella unhooked from all the wires!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll note that in these pictures she&#8217;s about 6 months old. The ones from the NICU were taken when she was 14 days old.</p>

<p>Teresa Young of Teresa Young Photography made this dream a reality and came to our home to take photographs of us in our backyard. She was so incredibly flexible. In fact, the day we had scheduled for her to take our photos, <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/im-getting-tired-of-the-er-when-bellas-gtube-falls-out-pt1/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Bella&#8217;s feeding tube fell out</a> and we had to head to Akron, an hour and a half away. We had to cancel!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2316" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-681x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="681" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-681x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 681w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-200x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 200w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-768x1154.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-640x962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /></a></p>
<p>So we rescheduled. She came over and was so kind and amazing. She even went for hand sanitizer before I awkwardly needed to ask! (Loving acts that speak to a preemie momma&#8217;s soul!) It was so nice to have her meet Bella, since I don&#8217;t get to share her with many people. We waited until the last minute to put our coordinated outfits on for fear of Bella vomiting on all of them. This was a great decision since she did in fact throw up all over herself and Dustin right before Teresa walked in the door!</p>

<p>I stressed so much about everything looking &#8220;perfect.&#8221; In the end I was just thankful that we were alive. And here. And able to take photos. I even considered paying someone to paint our fence (it only got one coat last season)&#8230;but that was silly and Teresa assured me she could make the photos look nice in our less-than-perfect backyard. She was right!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2320" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-682x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="682" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-682x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 682w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-200x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 200w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-768x1154.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-640x962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a></p>
<p>Bella was nervous. She really hasn&#8217;t been outside much and it was her very first time on a blanket in the grass! It was very humid and I was sweating buckets. My makeup was sweating off! BUT&#8230;Teresa did such a great job that when I see these&#8230;my eyes don&#8217;t immediately go to the imperfections&#8230;but to the joy we all have. Even though Bella wouldn&#8217;t give us a smile&#8230;she looks healthy and relaxed. She also looks very inquisitive.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2308" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4-300x200.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4-768x511.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4-640x426.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest&#8230;my thoughts did go to her birthmark. (The large red bump on her scalp) I can be a little insecure about it still from time to time. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/whats-on-her-head-a-hemangioma-story/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">We&#8217;re treating it because it was harming her,</a> but we probably would treat it regardless at this point for cosmetic reasons. I&#8217;m all for loving yourself as God made you&#8230;but this in particular can give her issues down the road and is a quick and mild fix. That all being said, I love it because it&#8217;s a part of her and what makes her, her. I&#8217;ve grown to accept it as who God&#8217;s made her&#8230;but know that if there&#8217;s a solution that will improve her quality of life&#8230;I&#8217;m going to take it. Especially if it&#8217;s not harming her. My eye does go to the red bump&#8230;as I&#8217;m sure other&#8217;s do, but I&#8217;m not sad about it anymore.</p>
<p>As my Grandma said &#8220;If that&#8217;s the only thing she&#8217;s taking out of the NICU with her&#8230;we can rejoice&#8221; Or as Dustin says lovingly &#8220;She&#8217;s so beautiful&#8230;maybe God put it there to keep her humble.&#8221; haha</p>

<p>These photos are what I dreamed of. They&#8217;re as &#8220;Pinterest Perfect&#8221; as they come&#8230;but not because they were from a perfect situation. They&#8217;re perfect because they represent a warrior in this little one. A dedicated village. A sense of determination and grit and heart. The represent the heart of our God. That he loves us and wants us to grow in Him.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2342" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1-300x200.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1-768x511.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1-640x426.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>So excuse me while I go cry in a corner with a handful of Hershey Kisses while reflecting on the simplicity and beauty that Teresa captured.  Here&#8217;s a post on Facebook that I made as soon as I saw the photographs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before Bella was born&#8230;before I was pregnant with her&#8230;before our miscarriage last year&#8230;I filled Pinterest boards with newborn photography. I dreamed of our little family&#8230;perfected behind a creative lens. I virtually &#8220;shopped&#8221; for outfits and themes.</p>
<p>After we lost our first pregnancy I deleted those boards&#8230;there wouldn&#8217;t be any newborn pictures.</p>
<p>But then we found out months later we were expecting Isabella. My faith in God gave me the courage to embrace hope. Hope t<span class="text_exposed_show">hat this little soul would be in family photos. Once again I filled inspiration boards&#8230;as the months went by they became tailored to a little baby girl <span class="_5mfr _47e3"><img loading="lazy" class="img" role="presentation" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/f3/1/16/1f380.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="16" height="16" /><span class="_7oe">?</span></span></span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>As much as we can plan, God directs our lives. I hadn&#8217;t dreamt that Bella would be born 3 months early and we would spend 110 days in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. I never imagined it&#8217;d take 60 days for my own mother to touch her&#8230;or almost 6 months for these precious precious family photographs.</p>
<p>While in the hospital a photographer took pictures of us when Bella was only 14 days old. Not yet 2lbs&#8230;these photos are now so special&#8230;even with her wires, no clothing, and cpap on. Yet&#8230;I still dreamed and hoped for pictures of our sweet girl free of hospital walls.</p>
<p>The road to these photographs is marked with loss, heart break, confusion, joy, peace, fear, and more. The truth that we are even physically here in these pictures does not fall short on us. We miss our first little one terribly, but are so thankful Bella and I are here. Tears run down my cheeks as I realize my dream of family photos has been honored by our amazing God.</p>
<p>And then, to add that the amazingly talented young women and friend who captured these has children of her own..and one who has/is facing medical challenges&#8230;blows me away. Teresa Young was so gracious and flexible. We had to cancel on her because Bella&#8217;s gtube fell out. We didn&#8217;t have our fence painted or even our own blanket to pose on&#8230;but she came to our home and captured these for us&#8230;at no charge. She used hand sanitizer without me prompting and understood how fragile Bella was and how she was one of the very first non-family members to meet her. I was sweating buckets and Bella was nervous being near grass for the first time&#8230;but it worked. These pictures are so anticipated and treasured. The power of God working through Teresa is incredible. Please, consider getting family photos done. Things don&#8217;t have to be perfect. You don&#8217;t have to be your goal weight or have everything figured out. I was terrified Bella would vomit all over. I was worried her birthmark would look weird. (She didn&#8217;t and it doesn&#8217;t). Whatever is holding you back, don&#8217;t let it. You won&#8217;t regret it. Consider Teresa Young. She&#8217;s amazing. Thank you for creating something priceless for me. And sending them at the perfect time&#8230;when there&#8217;s fear and uncertainty and nervousness in my heart for my sweet girl.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just be over here crying&#8230;and thinking up ways to display this dream realized in our home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Happy Easter Friends!</p>
<p>This was a memorable Easter for me. Dustin and I attended the Maundy Thursday service at our church. It&#8217;s been an interesting development for me as a Christ-follower because I never celebrated this day. In fact, NONE of the churches I attended had a service dedicated to this day. So, the last few years we&#8217;ve been learning about Maundy Thursday and what it means. Basically, Maundy Thursday is the day when Jesus and his disciples went to the upper room and had communion and he washed their feet. (And yes, even some Christians think it&#8217;s strange that we do this)</p>
<p>Maundy is Latin. It comes from mandatum, which means &#8220;command.&#8221;</p>
<h1>Washing My Husband&#8217;s Feet. It&#8217;s Awkward As It Sounds.</h1>
<p>We were asked to serve and as most things go at Mosaic, our church,  (on the fly) we found out once we arrived we may be needed to wash feet. Now, the whole thing is awkward. Anyone who tells you different has either 1.) been doing it a long time or 2.) isn&#8217;t aware of social norms in the 21rst century!</p>
<p>You&#8217;re on your knees. You&#8217;re touching someone&#8217;s (you may not know) feet. <strong>You&#8217;re not sure if you should scrub it, rub it, or go in-between the toes. It&#8217;s vulnerable and sacred and scary all at the same time. </strong></p>
<p>So, we embraced the command and followed in Jesus&#8217; footsteps and washed others feet. Men on one side, women on the other. We pour water over the feet, rub it a bit, and then dry it with a fresh towel. It&#8217;s all very hygienic and you don&#8217;t have to worry about the man in the back with athlete&#8217;s foot since we don&#8217;t share water. It takes a minute or two. Getting your feet washed is just as humbling as washing. It&#8217;s a very special moment.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t get a chance to wash anyones feet at first because all the women were doing one another&#8217;s. Dustin, on the other hand, was on his knees at the first pew washing from the beginning. It was a very special thing to watch him serve his brothers in Christ and reflect Jesus. At the end, I felt as if I should wash his feet, a prodding from the Holy Spirit. It&#8217;s a strange feeling and I&#8217;ll be honest:<strong> I didn&#8217;t want to do it.</strong> I touch his feet all the time (rubbing them, laying on the couch, etc) but it was awkward. I still knew it was important and would be a very special way to pray over him and  humble myself.</p>
<p>So, we washed each other&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>It was a super sweet moment. One I will never forget. To follow in the footsteps of our Father and submit to one another in love. Phenomenal. I prayed prayers as I touched his feet. God, give him strength. Give him Hope. Give him more and more love for you. Before long, we switched and he washed my feet. It was a very intimate moment.</p>
<p>I had a good understanding of washing feet before engaging in this symbolic ritual, but others may not.</p>

<h1>Why Do We Wash Each Other&#8217;s Feet As Believers?</h1>
<p>Today, as I was reading my devotional, I was shocked to come across the passage where Jesus washes the disciples feet. Now, I do a devotional at random. It&#8217;s not a date specified book and is a book about prayer. It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lifeway.com/Product/whispers-of-hope-p005567167?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Whispers of Hope by Beth Moore.</a> When I came across this section, I was encouraged. God knows I needed a reminder again about why we wash feet.</p>
<p>The passage can be found in John 13. If you take the time to read it, (and I encourage you to do so) it paints the story of Jesus washing his best friends and confidant&#8217;s feet. It says &#8220;he loved them to the end(John 13:1)&#8221; and &#8220;knew that the Father has put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God. (13:1)&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a simple process. He &#8220;poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ok, so, Jesus did this. Why do we? He was doing this with his disciples, why do I need to do it for others and my family? The answer is in verse 14.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another&#8217;s feet. I have set an example that you should do as I have done for you. Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Washing feet is a symbol. It&#8217;s not just about washing feet. It&#8217;s about humbling yourself both ways and allowing someone to serve you or serving another in a very real, raw, awkward way. It&#8217;s about putting someone before yourself.</p>
<p>We can wash other&#8217;s feet everyday without picking up a basin of water. Simply by putting others needs in front of your own is obeying this command.</p>
<p>Today, while I make the bed, mix up some lunch, or kiss my husband I&#8217;m reminded that I can wash his feet and humble myself like Jesus without physically washing his feet every day. Who in your life can you serve and put before yourself?</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>

<h3>Thursday, May 28th: Downtown Gatlinburg &amp; Dinner at The Old Mill Restaurant</h3>
<p>On this day of our journey, we were still with the rest of the family. We spent the day downtown Gatlinburg. We visited the <a href="http://www.ripleys.com/gatlinburg/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Ripley&#8217;s Aquarium</a> and also did the lift at <a href="http://obergatlinburg.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Ober Gatlinburg</a>. I had been to Ripley&#8217;s. It&#8217;s an awesome aquarium and you get to go &#8220;under&#8221; the shark tank. It felt like we had a personal tour guide since my sister-in-law is studying marine biology. She told us all about the different fish and sharks. Of course, my favorite part was the penguins. There&#8217;s a newer exhibit with penguins. They&#8217;re adorable.</p>
<p>Another stop was <a href="http://www.thevillageshops.com/donutfriar.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Donut Friar</a> (located in The Village Shops). I swear this little bakery  has the very best donuts in all of the Smokeys. I had a long john, in case you were wondering. We also tried lots of beef jerky and enjoyed tasting moonshine at <a href="http://olesmoky.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Ole Smokey Tennessee Moonshine</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_604" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-604" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/label-blackberry-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-604" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/label-blackberry-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="Photo Credit: Bootleggers Homemade Wine" width="300" height="326" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/label-blackberry-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/label-blackberry-2-276x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 276w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/label-blackberry-2-28x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 28w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-604" class="wp-caption-text">Photo Credit: Bootleggers Homemade Wine</figcaption></figure>
<p>My favorite place, though was a newer shop called <a href="http://www.bootleggerswine.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Bootleggers Homemade Wine</a>. This little shop sells wines that are extra sweet and have unique flavors. After tasting a few, we picked up a bottle of Homegrown Blackberry Wine to enjoy at our bed and breakfast. My in-laws picked up some Homegrown Strawberry Wine for a friend. Cute country t-shirts and glass mason jars are sold in the store. I really liked the packaging of the wines. The winery began with two sisters and they make all of their wines by hand. You can&#8217;t order online, you have to visit the location in the Smokeys to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ve heard lots about <a href="http://obergatlinburg.com/aerial-tramway/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Ober Gatlinburg</a> but I&#8217;d never been there. It&#8217;s basically an attraction park at the top of a mountain overlooking downtown Gatlinburg. In the winter you can ski or tube up there. Along with kiddie rides, there are animals on display and restaurants. We took the ariel tram too late in the evening and didn&#8217;t spend time up there. The view was wonderful. I&#8217;ll admit, being on the tram was a little bit scary, but it was fun to walk around and look into the mountains. Per person it was $12. It takes you 2.1 miles up into the mountains and can take 120 passengers. The Aerial Tramway at Ober Gatlinburg is also one of the largest in all of America.</p>

<p>Last, but definitely not least, we ate at <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/info/the-old-mill-restaurant?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Old Mill Restaurant</a> for dinner. This is one of my favorite restaurants on the planet and we make a point to eat there every time we are in town. Located in Pigeon Forge, this restaurant is one of the oldest attractions in the area. The food is ah-mazing. We&#8217;re talking Southern fritters, homemade chicken and dumplings, and lots of sweet tea.</p>
<p>For about $20 you receive</p>
<p>-a cup of corn chowder</p>
<p>-a side salad</p>
<p>-corn fritters</p>
<p>-an entree</p>
<p>-mashed potatoes and green beans</p>
<p>-dinner rolls</p>
<p>-homemade dessert</p>
<p>I was in food heaven. The chicken and dumplings were delicious. Made just like I like them. Dustin ordered the meatloaf. It was at least a pound in weight. Massive. We all had leftovers, including desserts. It&#8217;s safe to say we slept well that night on full bellies.</p>
<h3>Friday, May 29th: Alpine Coaster, Working from Starbucks &amp; Headed to The Yellow House Bed and Breakfast</h3>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/goatsontheroofalpinecoaster.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-592" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/goatsontheroofalpinecoaster-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="goatsontheroofalpinecoaster" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/goatsontheroofalpinecoaster.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/goatsontheroofalpinecoaster-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/goatsontheroofalpinecoaster-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/goatsontheroofalpinecoaster-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The next morning, we said goodbye to our family and they headed back to Ohio. I had found tickets for an alpine coaster on Groupon for $17 for two. The attraction was located at <a href="http://thecoastertn.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Goats on the Roof.</a> This center had games, rides, and a gift shop&#8230;it also had live goats living on the roof. I didn&#8217;t believe it at fist, thought it was just a sales gimmick, until we saw goats walking around on the roof. Above is the picture of where the goats live. There are connecting walkways to each building and the goats can walk around up and down the buildings and hide in the little barns. For a dollar you could buy food and use a mechanism to feed them on the roof. This was hilarious as the goats would anticipate the food and crane their necks to eat it. <strong>But, we weren&#8217;t there to feed the goats. We were there to ride the alpine coaster. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/alpinecoasterpf.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-591" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/alpinecoasterpf-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="alpinecoasterpf" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/alpinecoasterpf.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/alpinecoasterpf-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/alpinecoasterpf-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/alpinecoasterpf-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>An alpine coaster is basically a small roller coaster, only you have a hand held break which helps you slow down. The little cart is attached to a track and once you go up the mountain, you are let go and roll around circles and hills until you slow to a stop at the bottom. Dustin and I thought this would be easy peasy. Not scary at all. We love roller coasters and have been to Cedar Points lots of times. Well, it wasn&#8217;t a walk in the park. As soon as we began gaining speed I was hollering and Dustin was pulling the break. Even though you were wearing seat belts, it felt like you could fly off the side of the mountain. It was really fun and the dips caught your stomach. Well worth the $17. I&#8217;d do it again!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was time to work. We both had stuff to get done. After finding a Starbucks, we ordered drinks and hunkered down. It would be a few hours before we could leave and drive to our first bed and breakfast.</p>
<p>Once we finished up, we looked up the directions to Waynesville. The drive was about an hour and a half. We passed some fun places, including the home of <a href="http://www.bushbeans.com/en_US/visitors-center?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Bush&#8217;s Baked Beans</a>.</p>
<p>Next up, the best bed and breakfast we&#8217;ve ever visited. The Yellow House!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>My Sephora Gift Card Giveaway just ended! When I began this blog, I wanted to host a giveaway to get my blog noticed and to give back to those who have supported me in this journey. I scoured the internet to find the best way to host a giveaway. I didn&#8217;t know much going into it other than:</p>
<h4>1. I didn&#8217;t want to pay to host a giveaway on my site.</h4>
<h4>2. It needed to be super simple.</h4>
<p>Dustin, my techy husband looked too. After a few days I decided to try <a href="https://www.rafflecopter.com?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Rafflecopter</a>. This company has a free giveaway option. Of course there&#8217;s an up sell, ( I didn&#8217;t use these options, but you can check out their site for more information) but overall it was super helpful for a new blogger like myself.</p>
<p>To begin, Rafflecopter is free but you have to sign up. Once you sign up you can host as many giveaways as you&#8217;d like. According to the website, Rafflecopter began in 2011 as a free application and later added extras. Here are the basic steps I went through for my giveaway:</p>
<h2>1. Signed up for Rafflecopter</h2>
<p>This is a super easy step. You basically <a href="https://www.rafflecopter.com/?home&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">sign up</a> by giving them your email and then you&#8217;re given a dashboard where you can keep track of your giveaways. There isn&#8217;t an upfront fee or anything. It&#8217;s free.</p>
<h2>2. Purchased a $50 Gift Card from Sephora</h2>
<p>You need to decide what you want to giveaway. I chose to giveaway a Sephora gift card since my blog is primarily about makeup and beauty. I went ahead and purchased it before beginning the giveaway. This is a pretty simple step. <strong>Think about what a large audience would be interested in.</strong> Don&#8217;t pick something too specific. Gift cards work well because people can buy whatever they want with them. Also make sure there are many stores throughout the United States. My gift card also comes with a complimentary makeover at <a href="http://www.sephora.com/?om_mmc=ppc-GG&amp;mkwid=sAUTwFNBV&amp;pcrid=56327149457&amp;pdv=c&amp;site=us_search&amp;country_switch=us&amp;lang=en&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjw7_mrBRDH4Y2UjLHEmfcBEiQA8OTHf0TiXO9p4sJxgkrGzIqihoMGGr1VtoGDLnc4d5ZfG0EaAiVv8P8HAQ&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Sephora </a>and a little mirror for your purse.</p>
<h2>3. Decided What I Wanted Wy Entries to Be</h2>
<p>I personally think this was the most difficult part. Rafflecopter allows you to pick how people can enter your giveaway. Some of the options are only available for those who have more advanced subscriptions. I picked only the free options. Some of them included following my blog on Twitter, tweeting a message, commenting on a blog post, sharing a blog post on Facebook, following me on Instagram, and liking my blog&#8217;s Facebook page. You can create custom entries too and then assign them a number. For instance, just tweeting a tweet was only 3 entires while commenting on a blog post was 5 entries. People will want to do all of the activities so that they will get more entries.</p>
<p>Rafflecopter allows you to make people &#8220;prove&#8221; that they did the steps. In this case, you can have them link to the Facebook post they shared or offer up their Instagram ID so you can make sure they follow you. I decided to begin building my email subscription and offered entries if you gave your email.</p>
<p>You can also chose if people could perform an entry multiple times. I allowed that if someone shared something once a day they could get more entires.</p>
<h2>4. Decided How Long the Giveaway Would Last</h2>
<p>Since this was my vert first giveaway and there were many different ways to enter, I decided to have the giveaway last a month. <strong>Looking back, I think I should&#8217;ve made it a little bit shorter.</strong> I got distracted and didn&#8217;t keep up with it as much as I should&#8217;ve. Of course this did give people more time to enter it. Rafflecopter lets you pick when it starts and when it ends.</p>
<h2>5. Posted It On My Blog</h2>
<p>As someone who doesn&#8217;t know a lot about coding, I was nervous about this part. I remembered a few friends had used Rafflecopter and the site promised it was super simple to post on your blog. Well, it was! All you do is copy the code and paste it anywhere in your blog text. To embed it, just go to the &#8220;text&#8221; version of your blog post instead of &#8220;visual&#8221; and paste it where you want it. Once I pasted it, the little giveaway box popped up where people could enter. Rafflecopter also lets you post it on a Facebook fan page.</p>
<h2>6. Tried to Keep Up with Promotion</h2>
<p>This was the hardest part for me. I went on two vacations when the giveaway was being held and I didn&#8217;t write any new posts for my site. I noticed I got a lot of entries at the beginning, but near the end it began losing steam. The most entries I received were from Facebook. I&#8217;m pretty active on there and have a lot of friends and family. Along with Facebook I added it on Twitter and on Instagram. There was little interaction on those platforms. My husband also paid to have it promoted on a giveaway site. I&#8217;m not sure of the details of that but will write about it at a later time. He paid $5 I think of Fiverr.</p>
<h2>7. Emailed &amp; Announced the Winner</h2>
<p>Rafflecopter reminded me by email when it was a few weeks out and then before it ended. This helped me in posting it on Facebook and other places. At the very end I logged in and chose a random winner. The woman who won had followed me on Instagram and is from another state. It was easy because I emailed her through Rafflecopter and announced it on the plug-in as well. The next day she responded with her address and thanked me.</p>
<h2>8. Got A Spreadsheet with All the Entries</h2>
<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that Rafflecopter also gives you access to a spreadsheet with all the entires! This is such a great resource because I can see everyone who entered and all the information they provided for their entries. On the spreadsheet is also their collected email addresses (if they gave it to me for my email list). I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;m going to use all of this information, but I know it will be handy in the future as I develop the blog more. I had over 2,000 entries!</p>
<p>Here are my last running numbers:</p>
<p>-2,881 entries (Each person could earn about 31 entries)</p>
<p>-it ran a month</p>
<p>Once I review the other information I&#8217;ll have more numbers for you. Ex: How many individuals entered to win. How many people I personally knew entered.</p>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>I learned a lot! For $50, I was happy to give back to the blogging community and also get my blog out there. Here are my main takeaways:</p>
<p>-go with a gift card, not something too specific</p>
<p>-choose a dollar amount that&#8217;s worth someone&#8217;s time</p>
<p>-don&#8217;t pay money to host a giveaway if you&#8217;re beginning</p>
<p>-promote the giveaway daily on social media</p>
<p>-consider buying advertisement on Fiverr</p>
<p>-have fun!</p>
<p>Have any other suggestions or questions? Feel free to add your thoughts below!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>

If you&#8217;re checking this post out, chances are you&#8217;ve already seen some of my blog and want to know a little bit more about me and what I&#8217;m about. (Or where I began)</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;ve become a world-wide-web phenomenon and I&#8217;m working with Sephora and Taylor Swift is my bestie and calls me when her cats aren&#8217;t getting along.</p>
<p>Or&#8230; you may have just stumbled upon this itty bitty section of the internet by accident or by looking up information about T-swift&#8217;s <a href="http://www.etonline.com/news/2014/12/24121965/set_taylor_swift_coca_cola_640.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">cats</a>.</p>
<p>However you got here: I hope we can become fast friends and you&#8217;ll want to click around and stay awhile.</p>
<p><strong>Poeticlaughter is a blog dedicated to life and beauty through the lens of love.</strong></p>
<p>The journey to begin this blog is a long one with many attempts and failures. I remember when I lived in Chicago (in 2010) and worked in an office. I hated it. I lacked creativity and was sick of getting everyone&#8217;s mail everyday. Deep inside I knew I had <strong>more to offer the world</strong> and that I just needed the <strong>right push. </strong></p>
<p>A few years went by and we moved to Ohio. I began freelance writing and learned to have the confidence I needed to run an online business and express myself as a writer. Many different beauty blogs approached me and I wrote a lot about interior design, beauty, and travel. As I wrote, I realized I wanted to create <strong>something organic</strong>&#8230;something new that I wasn&#8217;t being monitored to write. It was through reading lots of different books about online business and flipping through many magazines that I realized:</p>
<p><strong>I have something unique to offer.</strong> There aren&#8217;t many beauty and lifestyle blogs that follow the latest trends but with an uplifting, empowering believers perspective.</p>
<p>So what does Poeticlaughter mean? It means that there is beauty and poetry in our life and laughter. It means that you can laugh at yourself and embrace your unique God-given talents in a way that doesn&#8217;t make others feel less-than. It means that whether you&#8217;re in your teens or are navigating retirement you can be beautiful inside and out while<strong> leaving your own mark on the world. </strong></p>
<p>On poeticlaughter.com I&#8217;ll be your guide, blogging about the latest in makeup, home decor, relationships and life! Although my primary focus will be on <strong>beauty</strong>, you may see glimpses of my personal life. I&#8217;m learning to love myself  well and the world around me one day at a time. Join me and learn a thing or two about lipstick, the latest in skincare, and if that hyped-up mascara is really worth $24.</p>
<p>Oh, and there may be a few posts about cats.</p>
