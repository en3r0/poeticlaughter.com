<p>We woke up at the Hampton Inn in Caryville, Tennessee and were shocked at the beauty that surrounded us! I knew ahead of time it was located in the Cove Lake State Park, but I didn&#8217;t realize you could see the mountains and a beautiful lake from the breakfast space! We began our second day of our road trip on Saturday, June 3rd. The hotel was pretty busy. Their breakfast was really well done. I loved the raisin bran and fresh fruit. Before, I would wonder what in the world a vegan would eat&#8230;but now it&#8217;s pretty simple. Fruit, whole grains&#8230;you get the picture.</p>

<p>My dad always took a picture of our cars when we went on vacation. I always thought it was weird but now I get it. You want to remember what you were driving and where! It&#8217;s harder to remember different parts of your life when you get older. Looking back you can be like &#8220;oh, I remember that clunker&#8221; or &#8220;oh, look at the two door thingy.&#8221; Well, this is our &#8220;new&#8221; 2014 Ford Focus that we bought last May. It was celebrating its first birthday on this trip. I didn&#8217;t post that we bought a new car on Facebook since it seemed a little braggy. Well, it&#8217;s a year now and I&#8217;m posting it here. I love the color. We got a great deal on it and it has AC! Our last car was the same as one as Dustin got for his birthday as a teen and it was on its last leg. We had the ability to donate it to a person which was awesome. So, yeah, here&#8217;s the car and it&#8217;s in Tennessee. I&#8217;ll probably look back at this and smile.</p>

<p>Selfies are hard! Â We are twins with our black Zenni-Optical $20 glasses. (It really does work, I was skeptical too) I&#8217;m also wearing a tank top I got from Volunteers of America for $2 before the trip! One of the best things about losing weight is finding clothes that are on sale that fit! Woohoo.</p>

<p>Take 2. Still squinting into the sun. I should&#8217;ve brought the selfie stick my brother-in-law got us for Christmas. It was a cool gift even though I laughed my butt off at it.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it strange how much easier it is to wake up early on vacation? I just needed to say that. Because my butt was up EARLY&#8230;and it never is at home. I think the promise of the fun day planned ahead had me excited.</p>
<h1>Big Green Dragon, Caryville, Tennessee</h1>

<p>Don&#8217;t laugh. Ok, laugh. It&#8217;s hilarious. I saw this road side attraction on the Roadtrippers app and had to see it in person. This <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/14021?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Big Green Dinosaur</a> has been there for quite some time. You can see it from the highway. It&#8217;s now behind a Dollar General store so you have to park and walk behind the store for a picture. It&#8217;s handmade from fiber glass. It&#8217;s been there since the 1980s. Don&#8217;t judge me, I read it&#8217;s history <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/14021?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">online</a>. Anyway, it used to be for a fireworks store until the store burned down. It&#8217;s funny because it&#8217;s a fire-breathing dragon. Our Dino met the road side Dino. We had fun with this. It was also less than a mile from our hotel.</p>

<h1>World&#8217;s Fair Park, Knoxville, Tennessee</h1>
<p>Next, we drove to downtown Knoxville, Tennessee. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been downtown there. I know we drive by the big gold thingy but never have I stopped to think what it was. Well, this time was different. The big gold thingy, also known as the <a href="http://worldsfairpark.org/worlds-fair-sunsphere.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Sunsphere</a>, was going to be our next stop.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1209" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6396" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 960w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>Parking downtown was a little challenging but we figured it out. The park downtown is lovely. There&#8217;s a big amphitheater where Johnny Cash and June Carter once sang. It&#8217;s big and green and relaxing. There were lots of families out and kids playing in one of the water features. There was also a kick-butt park. It had climbing walls and things you could hold onto and slide on. We walked to the <a href="http://worldsfairpark.org/worlds-fair-sunsphere.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Sunsphere.</a> It was free. At the base we just hopped on an elevator that took us up. The observation deck was cool. You can walk all the way around. There&#8217;s also history on Knoxville. That&#8217;s how I knew about the Johnny Cash thing. We were bored with it pretty quickly. I tried to hit the elevator button to take us higher (where other offices and a restaurant was) but it didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6398-e1467948499624.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1210" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6398-e1467948499624-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6398" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6398-e1467948499624-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6398-e1467948499624-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6398-e1467948499624-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6398-e1467948499624-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6398-e1467948499624.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>All and all it was a cool stop since we were driving through but I wouldn&#8217;t stop again for it. PS- It was built for The World&#8217;s Fair and most of it is still original. They charged $3pp to go up in it.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s one thing you got to know about me: I love animals. What do I like better than animals? Baby animals. What do I like better than baby animals? Nothing. Ok, I actually like feeding them. That&#8217;s why we stopped at <a href="http://thecoastertn.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Goats On The Roof</a> in Pigeon Forge. Last year we were here and road the Alpine Coaster. It was fun and thrilling. (It looks boring but it isn&#8217;t.) We went back to feed the goats who live on the roof. I&#8217;m not lying. You can feed the goats on the roof and on the ground. They also had baby goats. It was only 50 cents per cone of food. We bought 2 for $1 and fed the goats. Adorable. You can ride a bike that makes a chain move your cup up to the goats so you can feed them.</p>
<p>A tip? Walk upstairs in the shop so you can see the goats up close on the roof!</p>
<p>Our day was just beginning, but there&#8217;s much more to say in <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/one-of-the-most-magical-days-of-our-trip-hint-there-were-bears/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">another post</a>.</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
