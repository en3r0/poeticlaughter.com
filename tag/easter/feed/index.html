				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="rte">
<p>Easter and Spring is officially right around the corner! As the weather is warming up and my coffee order turns from hot to iced, my mind is on bright colors and outdoor fun. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re ever too old for gifts and bright colors. For this fun DIY, I decided to mix both. With some of my girlfriends in mind, I made these &#8220;Mason Jar Easter Friend Gifts.&#8221; Every single thing I purchased was found at the Dollar Tree and they only took a few minutes to put together. The best part in my opinion? The mason jars have glass handles so they&#8217;re more like summer mugs &#8211; perfect for iced drinks in the warmer weather.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0135_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1137" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0135_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0135_large" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0135_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0135_large-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0135_large-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>I began with some adorable mason jar mugs I bought. I didn&#8217;t bother to remove the sticker on the bottom. I&#8217;m not as OCD as some other DIYers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, I thought about what would go in my adorable Easter basket-esque Mason Jars. Along with the traditional candy, I wanted to add some items my friends could use everyday. I also wanted to keep the colors the same to make it look extra cool. My main focus was on a yellow, bright gift. I made sure each item I purchased had a yellow option. I bought:</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0140_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1139" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0140_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0140_large" width="480" height="333" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0140_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0140_large-300x208.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0140_large-30x21.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>-Hair elastics</p>
<p>-Neon pencils</p>
<p>-Neon mini gel pens</p>
<p>-Paper straws</p>
<p>I figured the girls could always use writing utensils, the paper straws would be perfect for the mason jar glasses, and your hair always needs to be put back in the warmer weather so the elastic bands were the perfect touch. I also kept in mind the size of the jars and the size of the bright Easter eggs I purchased.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0142_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1142" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0142_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0142_large" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0142_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0142_large-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0142_large-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>It was a little bit of a struggle to find yellow candy! I picked M&amp;Ms, Butterfingers, and Juicy Fruit. Other candy not pictured included Sixlets, Taffy, and candy necklaces.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0147_large-3.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1144" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0147_large-3.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0147_large 3" width="318" height="480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0147_large-3.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 318w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0147_large-3-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0147_large-3-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0147_large-3-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></a></p>
<p>Of course you can&#8217;t have a gift that&#8217;s inspired by Spring/Easter without this fake grass stuff! I began by stuffing some in the bottom of the glasses.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0148_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1147" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0148_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0148_large" width="318" height="480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0148_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 318w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0148_large-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0148_large-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0148_large-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></a></p>
<p>You may need to take a pencil or longer object to stuff it in.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0149_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0149_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0149_large" width="318" height="480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0149_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 318w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0149_large-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0149_large-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0149_large-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></a></p>
<p>Once all the fake grass is in, it&#8217;s up to you and your creativity to fill the jar up with color coordinated/or not so coordinated items.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0150_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1150" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0150_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0150_large 2" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0150_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0150_large-2-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0150_large-2-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>I thought a yellow elastic hair tie would work well in the smaller yellow Easter eggs.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0151_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1152" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0151_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0151_large 2" width="318" height="480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0151_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 318w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0151_large-2-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0151_large-2-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0151_large-2-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></a><br />
I also had a little yellow gel pen ready after placing some paper straws (aren&#8217;t they cool) and a neon yellow pencil in.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0154_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1155" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0154_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0154_large" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0154_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0154_large-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0154_large-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>The candy was ready, too!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0155_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1156" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0155_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0155_large 2" width="318" height="480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0155_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 318w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0155_large-2-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0155_large-2-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0155_large-2-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></a></p>
<p>Silly kitty, this gift isn&#8217;t for you!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0156_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1158" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0156_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0156_large 2" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0156_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0156_large-2-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0156_large-2-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>If an item doesn&#8217;t match the color scheme, like these Sixlets, I placed them in a yellow egg!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0162_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1160" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0162_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0162_large 2" width="318" height="480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0162_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 318w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0162_large-2-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0162_large-2-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0162_large-2-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></a></p>
<p>Once the jar is filled, it&#8217;s ready for giving! After I was done, I realized a little tag that says &#8220;For You&#8221; would be really nice. I added more fake yellow grass and made sure there was no empty space in the jar. What a cup of sunshine!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0165_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1164" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0165_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0165_large" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0165_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0165_large-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0165_large-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>I had planned to do three filled with yellow items, but I remembered my one friend loved pink. Since I had a lot of pink items&#8230;I went ahead and did a different color theme!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0171_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1165" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0171_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0171_large 2" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0171_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0171_large-2-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0171_large-2-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>Hot pink rules. I placed the hair tie inside the pink egg. Don&#8217;t you love the mini gel pen?</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0172_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1170" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0172_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0172_large" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0172_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0172_large-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0172_large-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re 10 or 30&#8230;Disney Princesses rock. So do candy bracelets. My bestie Jess will love this.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0175_large-3.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1172" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0175_large-3.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0175_large 3" width="318" height="480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0175_large-3.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 318w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0175_large-3-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0175_large-3-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0175_large-3-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></a></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have pink grass, but you still get the idea of the color scheme. To make this gift more personalized you could write the recipient&#8217;s name in sharpie on the cup.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes picture&#8230;the kitty loved bedding down on the fake grass.</p>
<p>Since the mason jars didn&#8217;t have a ton of room, I had extra supplies. I thought outside of the &#8220;Easter basket box&#8221; and used little clear plastic punch cups for mini baskets. These will be given to a few of our family members.</p>

<p>Happy Easter Friends!</p>
<p>This was a memorable Easter for me. Dustin and I attended the Maundy Thursday service at our church. It&#8217;s been an interesting development for me as a Christ-follower because I never celebrated this day. In fact, NONE of the churches I attended had a service dedicated to this day. So, the last few years we&#8217;ve been learning about Maundy Thursday and what it means. Basically, Maundy Thursday is the day when Jesus and his disciples went to the upper room and had communion and he washed their feet. (And yes, even some Christians think it&#8217;s strange that we do this)</p>
<p>Maundy is Latin. It comes from mandatum, which means &#8220;command.&#8221;</p>
<h1>Washing My Husband&#8217;s Feet. It&#8217;s Awkward As It Sounds.</h1>
<p>We were asked to serve and as most things go at Mosaic, our church,  (on the fly) we found out once we arrived we may be needed to wash feet. Now, the whole thing is awkward. Anyone who tells you different has either 1.) been doing it a long time or 2.) isn&#8217;t aware of social norms in the 21rst century!</p>
<p>You&#8217;re on your knees. You&#8217;re touching someone&#8217;s (you may not know) feet. <strong>You&#8217;re not sure if you should scrub it, rub it, or go in-between the toes. It&#8217;s vulnerable and sacred and scary all at the same time. </strong></p>
<p>So, we embraced the command and followed in Jesus&#8217; footsteps and washed others feet. Men on one side, women on the other. We pour water over the feet, rub it a bit, and then dry it with a fresh towel. It&#8217;s all very hygienic and you don&#8217;t have to worry about the man in the back with athlete&#8217;s foot since we don&#8217;t share water. It takes a minute or two. Getting your feet washed is just as humbling as washing. It&#8217;s a very special moment.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t get a chance to wash anyones feet at first because all the women were doing one another&#8217;s. Dustin, on the other hand, was on his knees at the first pew washing from the beginning. It was a very special thing to watch him serve his brothers in Christ and reflect Jesus. At the end, I felt as if I should wash his feet, a prodding from the Holy Spirit. It&#8217;s a strange feeling and I&#8217;ll be honest:<strong> I didn&#8217;t want to do it.</strong> I touch his feet all the time (rubbing them, laying on the couch, etc) but it was awkward. I still knew it was important and would be a very special way to pray over him and  humble myself.</p>
<p>So, we washed each other&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>It was a super sweet moment. One I will never forget. To follow in the footsteps of our Father and submit to one another in love. Phenomenal. I prayed prayers as I touched his feet. God, give him strength. Give him Hope. Give him more and more love for you. Before long, we switched and he washed my feet. It was a very intimate moment.</p>
<p>I had a good understanding of washing feet before engaging in this symbolic ritual, but others may not.</p>

<h1>Why Do We Wash Each Other&#8217;s Feet As Believers?</h1>
<p>Today, as I was reading my devotional, I was shocked to come across the passage where Jesus washes the disciples feet. Now, I do a devotional at random. It&#8217;s not a date specified book and is a book about prayer. It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lifeway.com/Product/whispers-of-hope-p005567167?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Whispers of Hope by Beth Moore.</a> When I came across this section, I was encouraged. God knows I needed a reminder again about why we wash feet.</p>
<p>The passage can be found in John 13. If you take the time to read it, (and I encourage you to do so) it paints the story of Jesus washing his best friends and confidant&#8217;s feet. It says &#8220;he loved them to the end(John 13:1)&#8221; and &#8220;knew that the Father has put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God. (13:1)&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a simple process. He &#8220;poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ok, so, Jesus did this. Why do we? He was doing this with his disciples, why do I need to do it for others and my family? The answer is in verse 14.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another&#8217;s feet. I have set an example that you should do as I have done for you. Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Washing feet is a symbol. It&#8217;s not just about washing feet. It&#8217;s about humbling yourself both ways and allowing someone to serve you or serving another in a very real, raw, awkward way. It&#8217;s about putting someone before yourself.</p>
<p>We can wash other&#8217;s feet everyday without picking up a basin of water. Simply by putting others needs in front of your own is obeying this command.</p>
<p>Today, while I make the bed, mix up some lunch, or kiss my husband I&#8217;m reminded that I can wash his feet and humble myself like Jesus without physically washing his feet every day. Who in your life can you serve and put before yourself?</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>
