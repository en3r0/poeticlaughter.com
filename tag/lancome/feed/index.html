<p>I about peed my pants when I found out I was selected to try the latest makeup line from <a href="http://www.ysl.com/us?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Yves Saint Laurent</a>! For those that don&#8217;t know, the brand is pretty pricey and is offered from the world-famous luxury brand. Personally, I&#8217;ve tried a handful of samples from YSL, but I&#8217;ve never tried any full sized items.</p>
<p>So, how did I receive this crazy nice makeup swag? Well, I&#8217;ve been a member of <a href="https://www.influenster.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Influenster </a>for about three years now. This program is online and allows different people to try new products and give feedback. Now, it helps that I have a lot of Facebook friends and have my own beauty blog. I think that&#8217;s why they send me more makeup than others. The program is completely free and I&#8217;m not paid to say anything in particular about the brands. In the past I&#8217;ve tried razors, makeup items, and even vitamins! This package is by far the highest valued item I&#8217;ve been sent and it made my day! I plan on writing a post later about how to become an Influenster and what to do to get sent some of the higher value items to sample. In the meantime, if you&#8217;re curious, just click <a href="https://www.influenster.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">here</a> and begin working on your profile and connecting your social media to the site.</p>

<p>Before I received this box, I received an email with a set of questions to answer. I answered that I loved makeup and was a Very Important Beauty Insider at <a href="http://www.sephora.com/?&amp;om_mmc=ppc-GG&amp;mkwid=sGT137elx&amp;pcrid=68913499937&amp;pdv=c&amp;site=us_search&amp;country_switch=us&amp;lang=en&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwr8uuBRCcg6-s-4TrmIsBEiQAN1TdEYff65jvto8nmfAqw811Cx0ItjCqJedqih4CRHRBdscaAg8v8P8HAQ&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Sephora</a> (I send $350+ per year there). Once I finished the set of questions, I received a confirmation email that I was receiving the box. It came a few days later and looked like this.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactinfluenster.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-765" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactinfluenster-1024x716.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="yslcompactinfluenster" width="1024" height="716" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactinfluenster.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactinfluenster-300x210.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactinfluenster-768x537.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactinfluenster-30x21.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Inside the box were two different YSL products and an insert with information about the Touch Eclat Blur line. The two main products were <a href="http://www.sephora.com/touche-eclat-blur-primer-P397615?skuId=1713114&amp;icid2=brand:yves%20saint%20laurent__p397615_image&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Touche Eclat Blur Primer</a> and the <a href="http://www.sephora.com/touche-eclat-blur-perfector-P397617?skuId=1713122&amp;icid2=brand:yves%20saint%20laurent__p397617_image&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Touch Eclat Blur Perfector</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactupclose.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-767" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactupclose-1024x773.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="yslcompactupclose" width="1024" height="773" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactupclose.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactupclose-300x226.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactupclose-768x580.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactupclose-30x23.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>Yves Saint Laurent Touch Eclat Blue Perfector</h2>
<p>When I opened the packaging I swear I had hearts in my eyes. The compact is Â beautiful and very luxurious to hold. The packaging is a pale pink with the iconic YSL logo in gold. Once you open the rectangular compact, there is a mirror and then the product. So, what in the world is this pink formula supposed to do?</p>
<p>According to Sephora, the product is a blur perfector. This means that the formula will help matte-ify your skin, blur overlarge pores, and give you a warm glow. The exact description says</p>
<p>&#8220;This portable perfector is Yves Saint Laurentâs first ever blur perfector encased within a compact. It transforms from a balm to a powder upon application to soften the skinâs imperfectionsâcreating a transparent yet subtle, rosy-glow effect. Use it alone as an allover complexion perfector, to set makeup, or as a mattifying touch up to sweep away shine and hide imperfections. Featuring one universal shade that complements all skin types, it instantly minimizes the look of pores so that skin feels smoother and the complexion appears more even. &#8221;</p>
<p>So, what did I think? Even though the packaging was beautiful&#8230;<strong>I didn&#8217;t like it</strong>. As soon as I opened it, I applied it on top of my <a href="http://www.sephora.com/lock-it-tattoo-foundation-P311138?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Kat Von D Lock It Tattoo</a> foundation. The formula from YSL didn&#8217;t mix well and basically made my makeup come off. I noticed the liquid makeup separated and drew even more attention to my large pores (sigh).</p>
<p>I thought maybe it was how it mixed with my foundation. I tried another day by wearing it alone. I didn&#8217;t notice a big difference, but my husband said my pores around my nose did seem smaller.</p>
<p>You use a sponge to apply the cream which then turns into a powder. The formula feels great going on and seems to eliminate oil. Unfortunately, I wear liquid makeup almost everyday. This type of product doesn&#8217;t work well with my go-to foundation so I won&#8217;t have a need for it. Along with trying it all over on top of my foundation, I also used it under and it did the same thing. Another time I only used it near my oily t-zone and again, it didn&#8217;t deliver. It was super disappointing for such an expensive and beautiful product. On Sephora, a lot of beauty lovers are saying they&#8217;re addicted to it. Perhaps it works better with other foundations? I may try to mix it with my <a href="http://www.clinique.com/product/1599/6201/Makeup/Foundations/Almost-Powder-Makeup-Broad-Spectrum-SPF-15?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Clinique Almost Powder Makeup</a>Â on a day when I&#8217;m not doing a full face of makeup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sephora.com/touche-eclat-blur-perfector-P397617?skuId=1713122&amp;icid2=brand:yves%20saint%20laurent__p397617_image&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">YSL Touch Eclat Blue Perfector</a> cam be purchased at Sephora for $55. If you didn&#8217;t get the hint already, I won&#8217;t be purchasing it. I feel as if there isn&#8217;t a need for this in my day-to-day makeup routine.</p>

<h2>Yves Saint Laurent Touch Eclat Blur Primer</h2>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve found my new favorite primer! After the disappointment of the compact, I was beginning to think Yves Saint Laurent products weren&#8217;t as great as I thought they were supposed to be. Thankfully, the primer proved me wrong. I received the primer from Influenster and it was a small sample size. The container has a gold top and has small flecks of gold suspended in the liquid. You apply it with a small sponge applicator. Overall, the product is supposed to help your makeup go on smooth, blur complexion imperfections, and give you a healthy glow. Sephora says,</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.sephora.com/touche-eclat-blur-primer-P397615?skuId=1713114&amp;icid2=brand:yves%20saint%20laurent__p397615_image&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Touche Elcat Blur Primer</a> preps skin for foundation application, creating an improved, refined appearance: pores seem to be minimized, skin texture feels smoother, and skintone is more even. Itâs enriched with four nourishing oilsâcorn oil, apricot kernel oil, passiflora oil, and rice bran oilâto leave skin feeling incredibly soft without a greasy residue. Packed with blur technology, this universal primer provides a subtle, golden shimmer for ultimate luminosity. &#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Boy, did this help my makeup stay put!</strong> It worked beautifully under my Kat Von D foundation (unlike the compact version) and made my skin look flawless. I even received a few compliments on my skin when wearing it. The gold flecks are interesting. I didn&#8217;t see them on my skin. I suppose they blend in? The formula is very silky. I felt like I needed a lot to cover my entire face. It absorbs quickly and helps acne stars look less noticeable. I&#8217;ve purchased <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/lancome-la-base-pro-perfecting-makeup-primer/2992830?cm_mmc=Google_Product_Ads_pla_online-_-datafeed-_-women:makeup:foundation-_-235900&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwr8uuBRCcg6-s-4TrmIsBEiQAN1TdEaEaNimtycUaQr3llCbTPb4IVdsELq2roZkrqe9_hsoaAmyi8P8HAQ&amp;mr:referralID=2ec03cf7-460c-11e5-8a28-0050569451e5&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Lancomes&#8217; LA BASE PRO</a> for $42 in the past. I would say the Yves Saint Laurent Touche Eclat Blur Primer works a tad bit better. It seemed to keep my makeup on just as long and go on just as smooth. The difference is that the YSL product helped my skin have a healthy glow. The Lancome primer didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Touche Eclat Blur Primer is $52 for one ounce of product. It&#8217;s a little bit larger than Lancome&#8217;s (.2 ounces more). I think trying this through Influenster has definitely won me over. I saw a promotion at Sephora to receive a deluxe sample of the primer. I spent some money just to get another container of it! Now, can I get myself to invest in a $36 <a href="http://www.sephora.com/rouge-pur-couture-satin-radiance-lipstick-P272319?skuId=1293463&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">YSL lipstick</a>? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="ð" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I received both products FREE through <a href="https://www.influenster.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Influenster</a> for testing purposes. My opinions are, of course, my own. If I like something, I&#8217;ll let you know. If I think it&#8217;s a waste of a dollar&#8230;I&#8217;ll let you know that, too.</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>When isnât it a good time to do a makeup haul? Well, I canât think of a better time than to celebrate my little sisterâs February wedding. Iâm the Matron of Honor and will be doing her makeup and mine! While my mum was getting her eyes done at the <a href="http://www.lancome-usa.com/special_offers/special_offers,default,sc.html?cm_mmc=LabeliumSearch-_-GoogleBrand-_-Brand-_-lancome&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Lancome</a> counter, of course I had to purchase a few items too.</p>
<p>What really convinced me to splurge was the gift promotion they were having. If you spent $35, youâd receive a bag filled with makeup goodies that totaled up to about $70! I remember when I was a little girl going to the mall with my mum when she purchased Lancome makeup. As one of their promotions, they would <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19860713&amp;id=RoYfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ps4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4740,6577813&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">give you a loaf of French bread</a> and a tote bag. Looking back, it seems so strange to give out a loaf of take-home-to-bake bread with purchase, but it solidified the idea that Lancome was a French brand! I stopped writing this post to call my mum and ask her about it. She began laughing as we reminisced. SheÂ said that when sheâd get her makeup from the booth, weâd always have a meal that went with French bread that evening! How neat! Long gone are the days when you receive a loaf of bread with purchase, but the company always has gift promotions that include makeup bonuses!</p>
<p>For the main item, I purchased a primer that Iâd been wanting to try for awhile: the <a href="http://www.lancome-usa.com/La-Base-Pro/1000205,default,pd.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">LA Base Pro</a>.</p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-la-base-pro.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="  aligncenter wp-image-46" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-la-base-pro-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="lancome-la-base-pro" width="449" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-la-base-pro-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 678w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-la-base-pro-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-la-base-pro-768x1160.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-la-base-pro-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-la-base-pro-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p>This primer from Lancome is designed to help your makeup look perfect for photos (and in person). What really sold me on it was the texture. The product feels like silk and isnât sticky or thick. La Base Pro is supposed to help your makeup look more vibrant while helping it stay put! I especially liked the products ability to diffuse light, reducing lines and imperfections. I have pretty large pores and have tried a lot of different primers. What this product did was smooth my skin and help it look much less oily during the day. Pricey at $42, this is an item I consider a beauty investment.</p>
<p>[Update]</p>
<p>I was pleased with the primer and used it on my sister for her wedding (and on me!) I noticed that her pores looked a lot better when it was applied and that her foundation went on much smoother. It was hard to measure how well it made her makeup last because she usually doesn&#8217;t wear foundation.</p>
<p>My skin, however, looked really great during the wedding and during photos. I kept some concealer and a beauty blender in my purse and only needed about two touch-ups. I have acne and uneven skin tones. The base really helped create a smooth surface for my blush and bronzer. Since I&#8217;ve been wearing LA Base Pro I&#8217;ve even gotten a few compliments on my skin. Muahah&#8230;if they even knew!</p>
<p>Included in the gift was a choice of makeup bag and many other goodies. Hereâs a breakdown!</p>

<p>I picked out this adorable makeup bag with my gift. There were two others to choose from but I loved the stripes and teal color. It reminded me of <a href="http://www.katespade.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Shop-Site/en_US/Home-Show?D1=2270606&amp;affcode=401343&amp;cm_mmc=Google-_-Brand-Search|Kate_Spade_Kate_Spade|Exact-_-e%20Ad_38542903053-_-Kate%20spade&amp;searchdef=2270606&amp;k_clickid=73f806af-98c4-6b88-9356-000056eae926&amp;002=2270606&amp;006=38542903053&amp;007=Search&amp;008=&amp;009=e&amp;012=Kate%20spade&amp;021=50465828493&amp;025=c&amp;026=&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=kate%20spade&amp;utm_content=kate_spade|exact&amp;utm_campaign=brand-search|kate_spade&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Kate Spade.</a> The zipper has aÂ flower with a crystal.

<p><strong><a href="http://www.sephora.com/definicils-high-definition-mascara-P54450?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Definicils Mascara</a>Â in black</strong></p>
<p>I almost purchased a full size of this mascara, but I&#8217;ll be honest, I&#8217;m waiting for <a href="http://www.sephora.com/roller-lash-P392516?skuId=1665082&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Benefit&#8217;s Roller Lash mascara</a> which is coming out at the end of February. Â I always seem to have trouble with my bottom lashes. Mascara rubs off and gives me raccoon eyes. I told my mum this and she said that she was in love with <a href="http://www.lancome-usa.com/Definicils/76805,default,pd.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Definicils</a> and it doesn&#8217;t smear. When our friend (a Lancome rep) brought out the primer, I was sold&#8230;but I was happy to get a sample of this in my gift. Mum was right: the product stays on and doesn&#8217;t rub. I&#8217;m impressed. I like this better for my lower lashes than my holy grail mascara: <a href="http://www.sephora.com/they-re-real-mascara-P289307?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Benefit&#8217;s They&#8217;re Real</a>. Mixing both products seemed to give off the best results. Definicils on my bottom and Benefit&#8217;s on the top.</p>
<p>Although mum said she liked Definicils, a few friends talked her into trying the newest mascara from Lancome: <a href="http://www.lancome-usa.com/Grandiose/990777,default,pd.html?dwvar_990777_color=Noir%20Mirifique&amp;cgid=makeup-mascara&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Grandoise</a>. I tried hers and liked it. The curved &#8220;swan neck&#8221; applicator helps you get every individual lash.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/makeupremover-lancome-sample.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="  aligncenter wp-image-53" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/makeupremover-lancome-sample-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="makeupremover-lancome-sample" width="449" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/makeupremover-lancome-sample-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 678w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/makeupremover-lancome-sample-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/makeupremover-lancome-sample-768x1160.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/makeupremover-lancome-sample-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/makeupremover-lancome-sample-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.lancome-usa.com/Bi-Facil/602581,default,pd.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Bi-facial Makeup Remover</a></strong></p>
<p>This product is a holy grail for many makeup addicts! I&#8217;ve never purchased a full size because I always get them free in bonus gifts. Right before my sisters&#8217; wedding, I used this to clean my<a href="http://www.beautyblender.net/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank"> beauty blender</a>. Let me tell you, it worked phenomenal. The makeup that had been inside the sponge grossed me out. I kept pouring the makeup remover on the sponge and running it under hot water until it looked like new! I haven&#8217;t yet had a chance to use the makeup remover on my face, but if it works half as good as it did on the makeup sponge, I&#8217;ll be impressed.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/moisturizer-lancome-sample1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-67 size-large" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/moisturizer-lancome-sample1-1024x832.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="moisturizer-lancome-sample" width="1024" height="832" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/moisturizer-lancome-sample1-1024x832.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/moisturizer-lancome-sample1-300x244.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/moisturizer-lancome-sample1-768x624.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/moisturizer-lancome-sample1-30x24.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.lancome-usa.com/Bienfait-Multi-Vital-SPF-30-Cream/990785,default,pd.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Bienfait Multi-Vital SPF 30 Cream</a></strong></p>
<p>I always get excited about lipsticks and other items in my gift but this was a pleasant surprise. With 30 SPF, you can&#8217;t go wrong with this indulgent moisturizer. Although I&#8217;m partial to <a href="http://www.lushusa.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">LUSH</a> products, I&#8217;ve been using this in the morning before I put on theÂ LA Base Pro Primer. The sample came with a lot of product and it didn&#8217;t feel too heavy on my skin. It smelled really fresh. I still prefer my LUSH moisturizer called <a href="http://www.lushusa.com/Celestial/9999900407,en_US,pd.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Celestial</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-gift-lip.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-45 size-large" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-gift-lip-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="lancome-gift-lip" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-gift-lip-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-gift-lip-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-gift-lip-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-gift-lip-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www1.bloomingdales.com/shop/product/lancome-color-fever-gloss-sensual-vibrant-lipshine?ID=87572&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Lancome Color Fever Gloss Sensual Vibrant LipSine in Hot Number</a></strong></p>
<p>This gloss was underwhelming. Nothing too great. Just a simple lip gloss. It has little color payoff and a lot of shimmer. Although this girl loves glitter, the product just wasn&#8217;t something I got too excited about. I did, however, put some on when heading to the church for my sister&#8217;s wedding (before I did my makeup). I really love the packaging and the application wand is nice. The smell reminds me of chemicals. If you like lip shimmer that&#8217;s a little pigmented, this may be your go-to &#8220;no makeup &#8220;makeup gloss.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-gift-blush-feb.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-44" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-gift-blush-feb-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="lancome-gift-blush-feb" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-gift-blush-feb-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-gift-blush-feb-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-gift-blush-feb-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-gift-blush-feb-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.lancome-usa.com/Blush-Subtil/746230,default,pd.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">BLUSH SUBTIL Powder Blush in Shimmer Pink PoolÂ </a></strong></p>
<p>This blush rocks. The packaging is really nice and I like the mirror which makes for easy application. Blush Subtil is oil-free and is a powder blush. The shimmer is the right amount and the color is a pretty pink &#8211; perfect for my skin tone! I don&#8217;t go through blushes too quickly so I think this will last me a long time. I like applying it with a peachy lipgloss and light eye makeup for a &#8220;fresh-face&#8221; look.</p>
<h2>Overall: It was a pricy investment.</h2>
<p>I do love picking up products that I know will last me a long time and will help my makeup stay on longer. Honestly, I wouldn&#8217;t have purchased the LA Base Pro if it hadn&#8217;t been for the bonus items and my sisters&#8217; upcoming wedding. (They get you with those bonuses!) I&#8217;m pleased with the product but I&#8217;m not sure how other brands would compare since I&#8217;ve never purchased a full-sized face primer. I&#8217;ve used samples of Smashbox&#8217;s Photo Finish Primer and Benefit&#8217;s Porefessional. They seem to be similar in quality but I can&#8217;t make a right assessment since I didn&#8217;t wear them as often.</p>
