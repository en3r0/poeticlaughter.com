<p>It was Saturday, June 4th, and we&#8217;d already done so much! After <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/big-green-dinosaur-sunsphere-goats-on-the-roof/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">feeding goats on the roof </a>(literally), we decided it was time for us to eat!</p>
<h1>The Old Mill Restaurant &amp; Shops, Pigeon Forge, Tennessee</h1>
<p>One of our all-time favorite places to eat is The Old Mill Restaurant in Pigeon Forge. The portions are massive and the food is so delicious. There are also a lot of shops and things to do before eating. We went into the shops at the Old Mill Square. <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/info/farmhouse-kitchen?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Farmhouse Kitchen</a> was adorable and there were lots of samples to try. We purchased some sparkling cider and some chip dip for Dustin&#8217;s parents who were graciously watching our kitties while we were away.</p>
<p>I was super excited to go into <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/info/sassafras?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Sassafras</a>. The shop was in a little corner and had some adorable jewelry. In the back, everything was an extra 50% off. I picked up both a necklace and a bracelet for under $10. There were lots of opportunities to try different olive oils and we snacked and snacked, tasting different combinations.</p>

<p>One of the neater stores we walked into was the <a href="http://www.randalloglegallery.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Randall Ogle Gallery.</a> Inside there were some beautiful paintings. The man there was Randall himself. We were able to talk to him and he told us more about Cades Cove and how to see a bear. His paintings were really peaceful. On the brochure I picked up it said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Smokey Mountain Heritage,&#8221; the focal point of native artist Randall Ogle&#8217;s work, depicts unique scenes of the Great Smokey Mountains. The largest collection of Cades Cove artwork in the area featuring the special edition series &#8220;Cades Cove, Yesteryear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once we had enough shopping, we grabbed a seat at <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Old Mill</a>. I hadn&#8217;t had cheese in a long time but ordered a small side of macaroni and cheese. Even though it was delicious, I regretted it later! The mashed potatoes, corn fritters, and green beans were to die for! It is truly a magnificent place. It was also the only time I allowed myself sweet tea on the trip. This was a hard decision for me, but I know it was a good one. Sweet tea has too much sugar in it!</p>
<h1>The Park Vista by Doubletree, Gatlinburg, Tennessee</h1>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1223" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6453-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6453" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6453-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6453-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6453-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6453-30x23.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Our room at The Park Vista was really nice. As a <a href="http://hhonors3.hilton.com/en/index.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Hilton Honors member</a> we got free bottles water and a mountain view upgrade. They also had us draw a prize out of a bowl. We won a coupon for a free appetizer at the hotel&#8217;s bar or restaurant.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1225" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6463" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>The hotel itself is a large cylinder. When I was a little girl my parents brought me here. I remember dropping a Toy Story toy down the 15th floor that we got in a kids meal. It was of an army figure with a parachute on its back. We would race to see whose hit the ground first. It looked like this:</p>

<p>Now, the hotel is owned by Hilton and has been remodeled. It&#8217;s up on a mountain and offers great views. The pool is also pretty fabulous. They have a nice waterslide that we went on a lot the next morning.</p>
<h1>Cades Cove, Great Smokey Mountains National Park</h1>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1214" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6421" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-30x23.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the hotel was so full (at 5pm) that we weren&#8217;t able to check-in to our room. This was super sad since it was a pretty pricey hotel room for one night. We shrugged and decided to head to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/cadescove.htm?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Cades Cove</a> since it was raining. Cades Cove is outside of Gatlinburg and is part of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. It&#8217;s a looonnnnggg drive. It took us over an hour to get back to the park.</p>
<p>Was it worth it? Yes. Because BEARS.</p>

<p>I prayed and prayed we would see a bear. I&#8217;d heard of others driving back and not seeing one and just seeing deer. I concluded that even if we didn&#8217;t see a bear it was a beautiful place (which it is)!</p>
<h4>It&#8217;s one of those untouched places in the world that makes you feel alive and free. The beauty was overwhelming.</h4>
<p>Lucky for us there had been rain. So, we got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">double rainbow.</a>  (A Full On Double Rainbow!) This was actually after we had already seen a bear. A young, adolescent bear, as Dustin would call him, pass in front of our car!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1213" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6419" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-30x23.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>What a beautiful sight! The Lord stays true to his promises!</p>
<p>We drove the 11 mile loop and ended up seeing not one, but two bears. The first was smaller, but went right in front of our car. We got out and got to see him very up close!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1212" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6407" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>We drove and saw ponies, turkey, and lots of dear. The wild turkey were pretty funny to watch as the moved their heads around in the grass. Later, we got to see a very large bear. This one I&#8217;d say was closer to 300+ pounds. He was further away, but we were on a hill and he was eating so we got to watch him well for over ten minutes. We actually left before he did!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6424-e1468372305750.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1215" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6424-e1468372305750-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6424" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6424-e1468372305750-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6424-e1468372305750-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6424-e1468372305750-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6424-e1468372305750-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6424-e1468372305750.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to make him out, but I think you get the idea. There were others with massive lenses and professional cameras. We just used our phones and tried to live in the moment. Other things we did at Cades Cove included visiting some old cabins and an old church. We walked into the church out of the rain and explored. It was too dark to take pictures. The cabin was very cozy. It would&#8217;ve been a lovely sight to wake up to the mountains every morning. Below are pictures we took right in front of one of the original cabins.</p>

<p>On our way out of the park, we had to drive very carefully because wildlife could jump out in front of your car. This is an example:</p>

<p>How majestic!</p>

<p>I love how the deer is reflected in the water on the road which was left over after it had rained. The smoke on the mountains was so beautiful. This is probably one of the best pictures I&#8217;ve taken with my iPhone! I made sure you could see our dash so you could tell we were indeed driving!</p>
<p>If seeing 2 bears, a double rainbow, and other wildlife wasn&#8217;t enough, we ended up getting to see a momma bear and 2 cubs! On our way out of the park, I turned up some worship music and settled in for the long drive back. We came across lots of cars parked. There, in the forest, was a momma bear and two cubs. The lady beside me said they were the smallest cubs she&#8217;d ever seen and that they were probably very young. We couldn&#8217;t get a good picture, but it was a very special ending to our night. Praise the Lord and His beauty!</p>

<p>After Cades Cove we drove back to The Park Vista and checked in. We enjoyed the room and also went down to their bar for our free appetizer. There was a lovely outside patio, rocking chairs, and fire pit. The space was called <a href="http://www.parkvista.com/gatlinburg-restaurant-lounge.php?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Fireflies</a>. The hummus plate was really good and we sat around the fire.</p>

<p>Later, we decided not to swim but to enjoy the room and watch Cops. One of our favorite travel tv shows.</p>
<p>It had been a long day, but I was so happy we saw BEARS!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>We woke up at the Hampton Inn in Caryville, Tennessee and were shocked at the beauty that surrounded us! I knew ahead of time it was located in the Cove Lake State Park, but I didn&#8217;t realize you could see the mountains and a beautiful lake from the breakfast space! We began our second day of our road trip on Saturday, June 3rd. The hotel was pretty busy. Their breakfast was really well done. I loved the raisin bran and fresh fruit. Before, I would wonder what in the world a vegan would eat&#8230;but now it&#8217;s pretty simple. Fruit, whole grains&#8230;you get the picture.</p>

<p>My dad always took a picture of our cars when we went on vacation. I always thought it was weird but now I get it. You want to remember what you were driving and where! It&#8217;s harder to remember different parts of your life when you get older. Looking back you can be like &#8220;oh, I remember that clunker&#8221; or &#8220;oh, look at the two door thingy.&#8221; Well, this is our &#8220;new&#8221; 2014 Ford Focus that we bought last May. It was celebrating its first birthday on this trip. I didn&#8217;t post that we bought a new car on Facebook since it seemed a little braggy. Well, it&#8217;s a year now and I&#8217;m posting it here. I love the color. We got a great deal on it and it has AC! Our last car was the same as one as Dustin got for his birthday as a teen and it was on its last leg. We had the ability to donate it to a person which was awesome. So, yeah, here&#8217;s the car and it&#8217;s in Tennessee. I&#8217;ll probably look back at this and smile.</p>

<p>Selfies are hard!  We are twins with our black Zenni-Optical $20 glasses. (It really does work, I was skeptical too) I&#8217;m also wearing a tank top I got from Volunteers of America for $2 before the trip! One of the best things about losing weight is finding clothes that are on sale that fit! Woohoo.</p>

<p>Take 2. Still squinting into the sun. I should&#8217;ve brought the selfie stick my brother-in-law got us for Christmas. It was a cool gift even though I laughed my butt off at it.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it strange how much easier it is to wake up early on vacation? I just needed to say that. Because my butt was up EARLY&#8230;and it never is at home. I think the promise of the fun day planned ahead had me excited.</p>
<h1>Big Green Dragon, Caryville, Tennessee</h1>

<p>Don&#8217;t laugh. Ok, laugh. It&#8217;s hilarious. I saw this road side attraction on the Roadtrippers app and had to see it in person. This <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/14021?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Big Green Dinosaur</a> has been there for quite some time. You can see it from the highway. It&#8217;s now behind a Dollar General store so you have to park and walk behind the store for a picture. It&#8217;s handmade from fiber glass. It&#8217;s been there since the 1980s. Don&#8217;t judge me, I read it&#8217;s history <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/14021?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">online</a>. Anyway, it used to be for a fireworks store until the store burned down. It&#8217;s funny because it&#8217;s a fire-breathing dragon. Our Dino met the road side Dino. We had fun with this. It was also less than a mile from our hotel.</p>

<h1>World&#8217;s Fair Park, Knoxville, Tennessee</h1>
<p>Next, we drove to downtown Knoxville, Tennessee. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been downtown there. I know we drive by the big gold thingy but never have I stopped to think what it was. Well, this time was different. The big gold thingy, also known as the <a href="http://worldsfairpark.org/worlds-fair-sunsphere.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Sunsphere</a>, was going to be our next stop.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1209" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6396" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 960w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>Parking downtown was a little challenging but we figured it out. The park downtown is lovely. There&#8217;s a big amphitheater where Johnny Cash and June Carter once sang. It&#8217;s big and green and relaxing. There were lots of families out and kids playing in one of the water features. There was also a kick-butt park. It had climbing walls and things you could hold onto and slide on. We walked to the <a href="http://worldsfairpark.org/worlds-fair-sunsphere.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Sunsphere.</a> It was free. At the base we just hopped on an elevator that took us up. The observation deck was cool. You can walk all the way around. There&#8217;s also history on Knoxville. That&#8217;s how I knew about the Johnny Cash thing. We were bored with it pretty quickly. I tried to hit the elevator button to take us higher (where other offices and a restaurant was) but it didn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>All and all it was a cool stop since we were driving through but I wouldn&#8217;t stop again for it. PS- It was built for The World&#8217;s Fair and most of it is still original. They charged $3pp to go up in it.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s one thing you got to know about me: I love animals. What do I like better than animals? Baby animals. What do I like better than baby animals? Nothing. Ok, I actually like feeding them. That&#8217;s why we stopped at <a href="http://thecoastertn.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Goats On The Roof</a> in Pigeon Forge. Last year we were here and road the Alpine Coaster. It was fun and thrilling. (It looks boring but it isn&#8217;t.) We went back to feed the goats who live on the roof. I&#8217;m not lying. You can feed the goats on the roof and on the ground. They also had baby goats. It was only 50 cents per cone of food. We bought 2 for $1 and fed the goats. Adorable. You can ride a bike that makes a chain move your cup up to the goats so you can feed them.</p>
<p>A tip? Walk upstairs in the shop so you can see the goats up close on the roof!</p>
<p>Our day was just beginning, but there&#8217;s much more to say in <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/one-of-the-most-magical-days-of-our-trip-hint-there-were-bears/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">another post</a>.</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t have a good road trip without gas, right? Well, I thought this would be a great photo-op! A few years ago we got this fun silicone bean-stuffed dinosaur. We have no idea where we got it. Dustin says we may* have found him on the beach somewhere. We&#8217;re not sure. BUT we like to take him on trips as out travel mascot. I know it sounds funny and some people don&#8217;t get it, but it&#8217;s kind of a fun way to document our travels.</p>
<p>Meet Dino, the Awesome Travel Dude!</p>
<p>Above is Dustin getting gas for our trip. I had some writing to do so we left around 11am on Friday, June 3rd and headed from Mansfield to Caryville, Tennesee. Our first stop was Jungle Jims in Cincinnati, Ohio. Other stops included Lexington, Kentucky and Cumberland Falls, Kentucky.</p>
<h1>Jungle Jims, 1st Stop, Cincinnati, Ohio</h1>

<p>Oh, hey, there&#8217;s me! I had a writing interview this day with Neutrogena. I thought it was going to be a video call but ended up just being a phone conference. In this picture I was trying to mimic Hayden Panettiere&#8217;s makeup since she&#8217;s one of the faces of the brand. A lot of their products are simple and not over-pronounced. I really like the blue eyeliner I had on. The lip pencil was OK. I forget the shade but it was one of their brighter ones. Can you tell my skin is clearing up? Ever since I&#8217;ve started eating a plant-based whole food diet it&#8217;s gotten a lot better. Oh, and I&#8217;ve lost 25lbs.</p>

<p>It took us about 2 1/2 hrs to get to <a href="http://www.junglejims.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Jungle Jims</a> from our house. This place is ah-mazing. If you love food and love traveling this is the place to shop. I would drive there just to spend the day. It&#8217;s a MASSIVE grocery store with foods from all over the world. My mum first told us about it and said they had $5,000+ bottles of wine. I didn&#8217;t get it&#8230;until I went for the first time. It&#8217;s seriously almost like an amusement park. They also give out free samples. It&#8217;s hard for me since I&#8217;m vegan, but they had some I could try.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6351-e1467944422563.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1190" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6351-e1467944422563-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6351" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6351-e1467944422563-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6351-e1467944422563-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6351-e1467944422563-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6351-e1467944422563-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>Outside there are animal noises and a really cool looking elevated train. You can&#8217;t ride it, it&#8217;s just for looks. Once you walk inside you&#8217;re overwhelmed with the size. The store even gives tours. We came at a random time but there were still lots of samples out. We had to limit our time or else we wouldn&#8217;t make it anywhere else this day.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6376.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1198" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6376-1024x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6376" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6376-1024x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6376-150x150.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 150w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6376-300x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6376-768x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6376-30x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6376-200x200.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a fun hippie theme in one section of the store. I told Dustin to stand for a picture. I think this was in the all natural section. The air steam painted trailer, picture of John Lennon, and tie dye clothes were perfect. We didn&#8217;t buy a lot since we were watching our money and brought out own meals. Things aren&#8217;t much more expensive than regular stores here. We bought some <a href="http://www.manner.com/en/original-neapolitan-wafers?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">wafers (Manner)</a> that we liked from Austria, some vinegar flavored edible crickets, a weird drink for Dustin, and some Italian pasta and sauce that we tried. The pasta sauce was from <a href="https://www.bongiovibrand.com/about.php?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Bon Jovi&#8217;s dad</a>. It was a garden marinara and it was excellent. The free sample got us hooked and we bought the $7 sauce and $2 pasta. Later, we made it at my grandparent&#8217;s cabin. It was so good! I later realized it had butter in it. A no no on my diet (and my stomach). Bummer.</p>
<p>PS- Go into the bathrooms. They look like porta pots on the outside but are really nice modern bathrooms on the inside. Mind = Blown!</p>

<p>Dustin and I also found <a href="https://www.rightfoods.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Dr McDougall foods</a>! This is the brand that started me on my whole foods plant-based diet. I love the food and now I&#8217;m vegan and feeling the best I&#8217;ve felt in years. I wanted a picture by the wall of the food to send to my family. Also, to keep track of my progress. One of my goals is to send my testimony to Dr. McDougall once I hit my goal weight!</p>

<p>There aren&#8217;t any words for this picture. Later, we sat in the car and tried a weird drink Dustin picked out. I took a video but forget where I put it. I hated it. The texture was weird. The basil seeds were slimy. I don&#8217;t think Dustin liked it because we dumped it out in Lexington, KY.</p>

<p>Last thing we did in Cinci was eat at Jimmy Johns. I only had eaten there once in Chicago and didn&#8217;t remember loving it. Well, we liked it a lot better this time. Maybe because we appreciate fresh food better. They had a vegan option for me too. I had a veggie sub with avocado and some kettle chips. The kettle chips were a splurge, but good!</p>
<h1>Mary Todd Lincoln&#8217;s House, 2nd Stop Lexington, Kentucky</h1>
<p>I had plans for us to stop at a neat little place called the <a href="http://www.rabbithash.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Rabbit Hash General Store</a>. This store is in Burlington, Kentucky and is one of the oldest general stores around. The town is known because they have dogs as their mayors whom the residents vote for each term. I wanted to stop by and catch a <del>glimpse </del>pet of the furry mayor. Unfortunately, as I read up on it and after we put in into the GPS we realized it burned down recently. So, we skipped it and kept heading to Lexington. Another stop we considered was The American Sign Museum in Cincinnati. This looked really cool but was $15pp and we wanted to hike more than look at signs so we saved it for another day since it&#8217;s closer to us.</p>

<p>Silly Dino selfie! Once we hit Lexington we were so excited to see all the cool rock &#8220;fences.&#8221; There were rocks stacked along the road and it looked so sophisticated. There were lots of horse stables (as to be expected) and charm. <a href="http://mtlhouse.org/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Mary Todd Lincoln&#8217;s home</a> was located right downtown. We parked beside the conference center and walked to it. It was closed, but we read all the information outside and got to see some of the other historic homes.</p>

<p>At this time, we were both needing to go to the restroom and needing some caffeine. Somehow I always notice when there&#8217;s a local coffee shop nearby. There was one near our car. <a href="http://dailyofferingscoffee.com/dailyofferings/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Daily Offerings Coffee Roastery </a>was across the street from the Hilton and smelled wonderful. I have been without coffee for close to two months but Dustin got an iced coffee and I got some of their orange black tea. It was delicious.</p>

<p>It was also a great time for an &#8220;Instagram&#8221; model shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look, you look artsy and mysterious.&#8221;</p>
<p>While walking we walked by a cool interior design store. I had to capture this horse that was encrusted with jewels.</p>

<h1>Cumberland Falls, 3rd Stop, Corbin, Tennessee</h1>
<p>After Lexington, we kept driving to <a href="http://parks.ky.gov/parks/resortparks/cumberland-falls/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Cumberland Falls</a>. We went here last year with out families. My dad took me there before as well. It&#8217;s on the way and is a cool stop. It&#8217;s also known for its moonbeam.</p>
<p>Traffic was rough and that was frustrating because the clock was ticking. I didn&#8217;t want to get there when it was dark. We crept up to the lodge and put on our tennis shoes. After a quick bathroom break we hiked down to the falls. It was a two mile hike from <a href="http://www.2geton.net/martin/moonbow/dupont_lodge.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Du Pointe Lodge </a>there and back. It was pretty steep. I remembered last year doing it and hating it. This year it was hard, but not as difficult since I&#8217;ve been working out. Before, I didn&#8217;t dare climb the rocks at the bottom since I was so out of shape. This time we climbed up them at the base and had a snack.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1199" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379-819x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6379" width="819" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379-819x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 819w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379-240x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 240w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379-768x960.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379-24x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 24w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379-300x375.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></a></p>
<p>It was really special. Sitting there watching the falls as the darkness fell. We were the only ones there other than those fishing. I snacked on a banana and some granola. On our way back up the sun went down. It was darker but we made it up fine. I kept running into spider webs though. That part sucked. I&#8217;d like to go back and hike even further. Our hotel was in Caryville, Tennessee. We pulled in pretty late. Close to 9pm, maybe later. We took turns showering off from the hike and had some McDougall meals. We watched TV and went to bed right away!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6381-e1467946244809.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1200" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6381-e1467946244809-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6381" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6381-e1467946244809-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6381-e1467946244809-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6381-e1467946244809-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6381-e1467946244809-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6381-e1467946244809.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>Dustin&#8217;s tired! We drove about six hours and hiked. I&#8217;d call that a good first day!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>
<p>PS- I used the Roadtrippers Ap which is free on my Iphone to find stops along the way. I planned it out ahead of time!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been awhile since I&#8217;ve revisited and finished writing about our southern road trip that we took at the beginning of this cram-packed summer. If you forget all we did or want a recap, check out my <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/a-southern-road-trip/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">overview post</a>, which links to each day individually.</p>
<h4>If you&#8217;re here just to see awesome pictures of our biplane ride, keep scrolling!</h4>
<p>Sunday, May 31st we left <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/two-nights-at-the-yellow-house-on-plott-creek-road/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Yellow House</a>, a quaint bed and breakfast in North Carolina and headed back to Pigeon Forge for our last night on our road trip. As usual, I was looking over <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/a371a6e5-ba68-419b-8dae-d4fdaf10c876?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Groupon</a> and found a bunch of different things to do. The thing that kept hitting me was a biplane ride. Of course I talked Dustin into letting me buy us tickets. After a quick call to the pilot, we determined a time and drove to the Pigeon Forge airport.</p>

<p>The deal we purchased was $79 for a 15 minute biplane ride for two people. I called ahead to make sure we could redeem it that day and then purchased it with my debit card online. The owner, <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/knoxville/life/former-sailor-takes-to-the-sky-in-historic-biplane_95698627?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Marc Hightower</a>, (click on the link for a cool post about him) was welcoming and personable. He explained that business was slow and he decided to do a <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/a371a6e5-ba68-419b-8dae-d4fdaf10c876?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Groupon</a> to get more business and get his name out there.</p>

<p>In the short time we spent with him, we learned he had rebuilt this  1927 Waco Model 10 himself. It was fascinating to hear that he flies it from Key West every summer to offer rides in the Smokies. His life was just as interesting. He had lived on a boat, owned a postcard store, and currently lived in Key West. Marc took the pictures you see of us with the vintage plane. Don&#8217;t let the smile fool you&#8230;I was terrified!</p>
<p>The company he owns is called <a href="http://www.skyhighairtours.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Sky High Air Tours</a>. You can see pictures of his plane and learn more about it there.</p>

<p>We brought our camera to get lots of pictures in the air. Takeoff was simple and so was the landing. The thing that surprised me the most was how loud and windy it was. After awhile you became used to the noise and it became really cozy and relaxing. Honestly, I could see taking a nap while flying! Marc was nice enough to give us hair ties (yes, Dustin too) so that our hair didn&#8217;t get in knots.</p>

<p>We both had headsets on so we could hear Marc communicating with the other planes and the airport before lifting off. It was really interesting. Dustin&#8217;s had a microphone and mine didn&#8217;t. While in the air the pilot gave us a tour, explaining the different sites.</p>

<p>Taking the bi-plane ride was one of the coolest things we&#8217;ve done together. It was really neat that it was vintage and restored. Overall I&#8217;d say it was romantic and the perfect touch to end out trip down south. The next place we stayed at wasn&#8217;t a good experience. I&#8217;ll write about that next.</p>
<h3>Would you do a bi-plane ride? Have you?</h3>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>While staying at The Yellow House, we took all day Saturday, May 30th to explore Asheville, North Carolina. Unfortunately I had a lot of writing to do, so after we finished breakfast on the porch of the inn, we drove to a coffee shop in downtown Asheville.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wakinglifeespresso.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Waking Life Espresso</a> was exactly what we needed to get our work done while in the mountains. This little coffee shop is located in a remodeled house and is light filled and airy. In the front there are bar seats and in a smaller room in the back there are couches and a table. The coffee was no-frills and especially delicious. To see how serious they are about their coffee, watch this <a href="https://vimeo.com/103960232?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">video</a>.</p>
<p>I worked on my articles and Dustin just hung out. (Perhaps working? I&#8217;m not sure.) At about 2:00pm, we drove the ten minutes to <a href="http://www.biltmore.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Biltmore</a>, the main attraction for the day.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tiffinfrontofbiltmore.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-666" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tiffinfrontofbiltmore-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="tiffinfrontofbiltmore" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tiffinfrontofbiltmore.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tiffinfrontofbiltmore-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tiffinfrontofbiltmore-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tiffinfrontofbiltmore-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>When I was a little girl, I remember visiting The Biltmore. This mansion is known as the largest privately owned house in the United States. It&#8217;s interesting because Dustin had also been there with his parents when he was eighteen. We remembered bits and parts (like the indoor swimming pool) but wanted to go together. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/two-nights-at-the-yellow-house-on-plott-creek-road/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Yellow House</a> was about thirty minutes from Asheville, where The Biltmore is located.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/staircaseofbiltmore.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-659" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/staircaseofbiltmore-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="staircaseofbiltmore" width="678" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/staircaseofbiltmore-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 678w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/staircaseofbiltmore-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/staircaseofbiltmore-768x1160.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/staircaseofbiltmore-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/staircaseofbiltmore-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/staircaseofbiltmore.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></a></p>
<p>The price tag was enough to shy us away, but we decided since we were close we should go. My love for interiors and art history really helped to sway the decision to drop the $120 ($60 per ticket) and spend the day there. I also used my vacation money to buy the tickets.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/biltmoredarkaway.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-636" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/biltmoredarkaway-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="biltmoredarkaway" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/biltmoredarkaway.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/biltmoredarkaway-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/biltmoredarkaway-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/biltmoredarkaway-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Words and pictures really don&#8217;t do this place justice. It took hours to tour and there was a room dedicated to arranging flowers. The Vanderbilt&#8217;s, who owned the home, were fascinating people who loved art and each other. An example of architecture from The Gilded Age, the mansion has <strong>252 rooms</strong>.</p>

<p>Pictures and videos are prohibited of the inside. George Vanderbilt shared a love for technology and entertaining guests. It was really interesting to see the parallels between the couple, George and Edith, and us. He loved technology and had electricity throughout the home and Edith loved books and taking care of guests.

It reminded me of the library in <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>! This couple was madly in love and took the best care of those they employed. Even the servants quarters were nice!</p>

<p>Dustin and I found ourselves staring on multiple occasions at the craziness of it all. The massive dining room had <strong>three fireplaces</strong> and there were separate rooms dedicated to guns, smoking, and games. I personally loved seeing the restored furniture and paintings by famous artists.</p>

<p>You can easily spend more than a day at The Biltmore. Along with the mansion, there is shopping, dining, a winery, hiking trails, gardens, and entertainment. There are hotels on site and even tours for taking horseback rides. We didn&#8217;t have enough time to see everything, but after going through the mansion we enjoyed the gardens for a bit. We drove over to Antler Hill Village where there were shops and a winery. While there, there was also live music in the center gazebo.</p>
<p>We brought our own snacks and got an appetizer at <a href="http://www.biltmore.com/visit/things-to-do/dining/cedrics-tavern?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Cedric&#8217;s Tavern</a> located at the <a href="http://www.biltmore.com/visit/village-winery?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Antler Hill Village</a>. We had hoped to eat dinner at Cedric&#8217;s, but after seeing the menu, nothing seemed that good. The place was over-priced. Since we were hungry and still had more to see, we ordered an appetizer. It was way too salty and not very good. After wasting $20 on an appetizer and water, we asked for our bill.</p>
<p>The winery wasn&#8217;t anything too special. We tried a few wines but didn&#8217;t like waiting in line. (Wine tasting is free with your ticket.) After buying a book about the mansion, we left to eat somewhere outside of the park.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a really neat experience. A $60 ticket only included admission to the mansion and property. The audio tour was an additional amount and there were other behind-the-scenes tours we didn&#8217;t take. I felt that the $60 ticket was fine for us. We saw plenty and I purchased a book to learn even more.</p>

<p>Dustin and I said we loved it, but wouldn&#8217;t go back anytime soon. <strong>It was one of those places that you go once and don&#8217;t need to keep going back.</strong> I would like to see it decorated for Christmas though. The property was very romantic.</p>

<p>In the future, we&#8217;d go back if we had kids. It&#8217;s one of those places that&#8217;s so out of this world, but very expensive. If you plan on going, eat ahead of time or bring snacks. We left and ate at an amazing place called The White Duck Taco.</p>

<p>While walking about, we acted like we owned the place. We laughed and told stories about our day to day lives as millionaires. It was fun to dream.</p>

<p>You could go and spend a day just going through the gardens. It felt like I was transported into the book <em>The Secret Garden</em>. It was hot and we were hungry so we only walked a short ways and drove the rest. I don&#8217;t usually suggest buying more than a one day ticket, but for The Biltmore, it would be worth it.</p>
<p>This stop on May, 30th was one of our favorite places on our Southern Road Trip. To see an overview of all we did on this vacation, <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/a-southern-road-trip/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">click here</a>!</p>
<h3>Have you been to Asheville? Have you seen the massive Christmas tree at The Biltmore?</h3>

<p>When we went off on our own, we headed to <a href="http://www.theyellowhouse.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Yellow House On Plott Creek Road</a>. This little bed and breakfast is located in the charming town of Waynesville, North Carolina. I had heard of it through Groupon. For $299, you received a two-night stay in a suite, checking in on Friday. As usual, I read reviews before purchasing the deal and saw plenty of high ratings. The pictures looked fantastic. We left Starbucks and drove straight to the bed and breakfast in the rain. I hadn&#8217;t realized we were running a little late for check-in, so I called ahead and let the inn-keeper know. Shawn was extremely accommodating welcomed us at the door.</p>

<h3>Friday, May 29th: First Night at The Yellow House &amp; Dinner at The Sweet Onion</h3>
<p>As soon as we drove up, the air seemed to get lighter. There was a magical feeling about this place. It felt as if we had gone back in time. The yellow house overlooked a lot of greenery and you could see it from the road. The mountains in the background looked like someone had painted them. We heard a bunch of folks talking on the front porch and saw some plates and glasses of wine.</p>

<p>When we walked in, a man introduced himself as Shawn. He began whisking us around the old home, pointing out port wine, a pantry full of snacks, a cheese plate, and board games. <strong>It felt like we were coming back home to place we&#8217;d never been. </strong>There were about ten different people eating appetizers and visiting in the parlor and front porch. Shawn explained that it was their cheese and wine reception.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-623" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhousestaircase" width="678" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 678w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-768x1160.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></a></p>
<p>The floor creaked below our feet and the china in the cabinets softly clinked as we walked into the butler pantry. Shawn told us to help ourselves to snack bars, cereal, fresh fruit, and cookies (he baked fresh every day). He showed us the hot water for tea and where we could leave our plates. There was also a room with books and lots of board games. Before taking us to our suite, which was located in another building, Shawn explained that the inn had plenty of material on the town and all the menus from local restaurants.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-621" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhouseparlor" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>I noticed the inn was clean and well appointed. It was cozy and worn but not stuffy. A large clock stood to the right and there was a buffet with port wine and small glasses. On the coffee table there were lots of different photo books dedicated to the bed and breakfast. My favorite was a day in the life of the inn&#8217;s cat. Shawn had made the book, telling the story of the inn from the resident cat&#8217;s perspective. Another book was filled with pictures of the inn during different seasons.</p>

<p>We followed Shawn up a small road to another building that housed our suite.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-600" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhouseviewofsuite" width="678" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 678w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-768x1160.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></a></p>
<p>We booked the Kinsale Suite. It&#8217;s located in a small house overlooking the upper pond. Along with a front area with rocking chairs, the suite had a small porch in the back. I loved hearing the creek as we got out of our car and Shawn climbed out of his golf cart .</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-601" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhousewithcar" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Once inside, I was surprised at how clean and cozy the space felt. Shawn showed us around, offering instructions on the double-sided fireplace and showing us how to close the built-in blinds. He also explained that the fridge was stocked with complimentary drinks and told us how the air-jetted tub worked. He told us he&#8217;d leave some cheese and crackers out a little bit longer and told us to hurry back to the house and eat. I sat some bags down and headed over.</p>
<p>The wine and cheese reception was great. Shawn had two different types of wine, china laid out, hummus, crackers, different cheeses, and snacks. We both grabbed some plates and a glass of wine. Sitting on the front porch, we took a deep breath and looked over the property. You could hear the birds chirping and glasses clinking. Some people were sitting inside, others at the outside sitting area. Afterwards, we looked around at the menus collected in a basket near the reception area. Shawn told us that there would be a wait since we didn&#8217;t have reservations. I laughed. We were in the middle of nowhere, how could there be a wait for dinner? After deciding on a place called The Sweet Onion, we went back to the suite to freshen up.</p>

<p>The Kinsale was ideal. The bed was extra comfy and I loved the unique art and furniture.</p>

<p>We adjusted the individual thermostat and turned up the air conditioning. I looked around, inspecting the room. I loved the double-sided fireplace that could be enjoyed from the bed and bathtub.</p>

<p>The space was large, with two separate rooms and a bathroom with a walk-in shower. The tub was sparkling and had Yellow House branded bath salts beside it and soaps. I also noticed handmade mugs with the bed and breakfast&#8217;s logo on them by the coffee maker.</p>

<p>There was an ice box, microwave, coffee maker, and fridge. Inside the fridge were bottled juices, sodas, and Perrier Sparkling Bottled Water. Coffee and tea was placed in a basket near a roll of paper towels. There were also extra cozy robes with the bed and breakfast&#8217;s logo on them hanging up. They smelled like fresh linen and were really soft to the touch.</p>

<p>Another unique touch was a dark hand towel with the words &#8220;Make Up&#8221; embroidered onto it. The rest of the towels were white, so this was a good place to take off my red lipstick.</p>

<p>After freshening up, we drove to <a href="http://www.sweetonionrestaurant.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Sweet Onion</a>. Sure enough, Shawn had been right. There was a thirty minute wait for the Southern farm fresh restaurant. Downtown Waynesville, The Sweet Onion made me think of a New Age hippie that grew up in the South. There were waiters with cool tattoos serving up fresh fritters and fried chicken. Water was poured into mason jars and the place felt like a modern southern diner&#8230;only more pricey.</p>

<p>The food was phenomenal. I ordered chicken fingers with macaroni and cheese. Dustin had a chicken parmesan sandwich. We talked and talked and laughed. It was a wonderful meal. When we left, we decided to walk around the little town.</p>

<p>Waynesville is quaint. It reminds me of the town in the book/movie <em>The Notebook</em>. There are cute little shops with mountains as the backdrop. Even though it&#8217;s a country area, there are nice art shops and galleries. Everything was closed but the May air was hot. We walked and walked. There were a few bars and pizza joints open. I was surprised to see an old theater. <a href="http://www.38main.com/index.php/about-us?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Strand</a> is a boutique theater that offers free viewings of movies. It was late and we wanted to enjoy our room. If we weren&#8217;t tired we would have watched a movie and ordered some homemade sodas. There were lots of people walking dogs and we even looked in the window of a dog bakery. Sleepy, we headed back to the Yellow House amidst the mountains.</p>

<p>We walked to the Yellow House (a four minute walk) from our suite. Shawn had showed us the code to get in. Lights were low and people were talking upstairs. We sat in the parlor and drank small glasses of port wine. We talked about our dinner and moving to the mountains. After grabbing a board game, we headed back to our room. There were matches and small aromatic candles near the bath. I took a relaxing bath and we went to sleep early.</p>

<p>The next morning, we walked to the front porch for breakfast. Shawn asked us if we wanted to eat inside or outside. Of course we said outside. The weather and view was perfect! A few welcoming women waited on us and offered us juice and coffee. Shawn was walking around in an apron, visiting casually with other guests. I could smell the food.</p>

<p>The first morning we had the following: fruit cups with yogurt, bacon, peach french toast, and more fruit for dessert with powdered sugar. The peach french toast was delicious. Shawn handed out recipe cards. The next morning we had fruit, asparagus, tator tots, and ham spinach quiche.</p>

<p>The portion sizes were abundant. We were seated with another couple. After visiting, we realized we had a lot in common. This was their second time there using a Groupon and they had driven from Atlanta, Georgia. They were both Christians and we found that out from where the wife had gone to college (another conservative-Christian school). It was really nice to get to visit with other Christians. What a blessing! I wish I would&#8217;ve gotten their information. The husband was from Ecuador and had a strong accent. The wife had also lived in Chicago near Lincoln Square. We knew a lot of the same areas and subway stops. (We also had matching blue nail polish!)</p>

<p>That day, Saturday, May 30th,  we explored Asheville, North Carolina. Among the things we did was work at a coffee shop, visit the Biltmore, and eat at a local taco place. We left The Yellow House on Sunday, May 31st.</p>

<p>A few times we saw a black and white kitty lazying around the property. We walked around and enjoyed the outdoors. It was kept beautifully. There were lots of butterflies and other birds.</p>

<p>Dustin managed to find a hammock. He laid back and took a deep breath in. We were relaxed and wanted to stay a few more nights. While checking out, Shawn told us more about the area and also told us the brand of the port wine we sipped (Taylor Tawny Port). Before heading out, we played cards on the front porch.</p>

<p>It was such a lovely experience. The Groupon deal is gone but I&#8217;ve heard they have them occasionally. Even if you don&#8217;t have a Groupon it&#8217;s well worth it for the stay. You can read lots of reviews on <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g49648-d80701-Reviews-The_Yellow_House_on_Plott_Creek_Road-Waynesville_North_Carolina.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Tripadvisior</a>. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49648-d80701-r276564007-The_Yellow_House_on_Plott_Creek_Road-Waynesville_North_Carolina.html#REVIEWS?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">link</a> to my contribution. This bed and breakfast way by far one of the nicest we&#8217;ve visited. If you stay, tell Shawn we said hello!</p>

<p>As promised, I will be breaking down our southern road trip. We began our trip on Monday, May 25th with family. To see the whole trip overview <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/a-southern-road-trip/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">click here</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Monday, May 25th: Cumberland Falls </strong></h3>
<p>While driving down to Pigeon Forge, we stopped at <a href="http://parks.ky.gov/parks/resortparks/cumberland-falls/history.aspx?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Cumberland Falls</a>. Located in the Daniel Boone National Forest near Corbin, Kentucky, this falls is a popular destination for those wanting to see the moonbow (a rainbow seen under a full moon). We visited during the afternoon and hiked about two-three miles. It was really hot and humid, but it was a good hike and the falls were worth the trek. You can also just drive straight up to the falls.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fallsinkydustinshot.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-551" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fallsinkydustinshot-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="fallsinkydustinshot" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fallsinkydustinshot.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fallsinkydustinshot-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fallsinkydustinshot-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fallsinkydustinshot-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Do you see the small raft in the corner of the picture? It helps you get an idea of how big the falls are. The rocks at the bottom are really large. I learned there was once a hotel overlooking the water but it burned down 1949.</p>

<p>After hiking, we drove to Knoxville, TN. We stayed the night at the Hampton Inn. I love Hampton Inns. This one had a salt water pool! The next morning, we woke up and drove into the Smoky Mountain National Park.</p>

<h3><strong>Tuesday, May 26th: Smoky Mountain National Park, Cherokee Village, the Cabin </strong></h3>
<p>On Tuesday we woke up and drove into the Smoky Mountain National Park. Together, it was me, my dad, Dustin&#8217;s mum and dad, his brother,  his little sister, and Dustin. We stopped at an overlook and took the picture below of Gatlinburg. I&#8217;ve stayed at the hotel that&#8217;s higher up. It&#8217;s also where my little sister stayed on her honeymoon. It&#8217;s currently owned by Hilton and is called <a href="http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/tennessee/the-park-vista-a-doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-gatlinburg-GKTPVDT/index.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Park Vista by Doubletree</a>. It&#8217;s really cool and has a 15-story atrium.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smokeymountainsoverlookgatliburg.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-568" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smokeymountainsoverlookgatliburg-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="smokeymountainsoverlookgatliburg" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smokeymountainsoverlookgatliburg.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smokeymountainsoverlookgatliburg-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smokeymountainsoverlookgatliburg-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smokeymountainsoverlookgatliburg-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Along with stopping a the park&#8217;s visitors center, we hiked to Laurel Falls. After that, we drove over the mountain to <a href="http://visitcherokeenc.com/#home?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Cherokee</a> in North Carolina. I remember visiting this little village when I was a small girl. It&#8217;s on an Indian reservation and has many different shops. It seemed a little run down and there weren&#8217;t many people there. Just going over the mountain was worth the trip, but I probably wouldn&#8217;t suggest going to Cherokee unfortunately. It just isn&#8217;t how it used to be.</p>
<p>After Cherokee, we drove back over the mountain and found our cabin! The cabin was rented through <a href="http://www.cabinsofthesmokymountains.com/gatlinburg-cabin-rental/Love_View_More.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Cabins of the Smoky Mountains</a>. Since we were staying in May, we received a great discount. I believe it was less than $300 per night and we stayed three nights. Dad and Dustin&#8217;s dad and mum shared the cost of the cabin. Dustin and I later contributed by paying for everyone&#8217;s aerial tram ride, which was about $85. The actual cabin name was Love View More.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cabinloveviewmoreoverview.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-543" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cabinloveviewmoreoverview-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="cabinloveviewmoreoverview" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cabinloveviewmoreoverview.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cabinloveviewmoreoverview-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cabinloveviewmoreoverview-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cabinloveviewmoreoverview-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The cabin was massive. It&#8217;s probably one of the nicest places I&#8217;ve ever stayed. Five balconies, four massive bedrooms, five bathrooms, a theater room, a game room, and more.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mainprochatcabin.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-560" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mainprochatcabin-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="mainprochatcabin" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mainprochatcabin.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mainprochatcabin-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mainprochatcabin-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mainprochatcabin-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>We spent a lot of time on the front porch, which was attached to the living room and dining room. The view was spectacular. I can&#8217;t even describe it.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/viewfromloveviewmorecabin.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-572" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/viewfromloveviewmorecabin-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="viewfromloveviewmorecabin" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/viewfromloveviewmorecabin.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/viewfromloveviewmorecabin-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/viewfromloveviewmorecabin-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/viewfromloveviewmorecabin-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>

<p>Above is a picture of the view from the front porch. We all got a private bedroom except Dustin&#8217;s siblings who shared. Each bedroom had it&#8217;s own bathroom, some with double sinks. The master suite was Dustin&#8217;s parents room. It had it&#8217;s own private balcony, a garden tub, vaulted ceilings, and a master bathroom.</p>

<p>Dustin and I picked the bedroom in the basement. There were glass doors that led to the hot tub on the bottom level. There was also a private bathroom attached. I loved the king sized bed and the decorations were really fun. We had plenty of room!</p>

<p>Below is a picture of one of the other bedrooms. When we arrived the towels were folded. I loved the exposed beams and wood. Each bedroom also had a flat screen tv.</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t spend that much time in the family room. Instead, we found ourselves at the dining room table, out on the porches, or playing in the game room. Although this room was wonderful. The TV (not pictured) was massive and the couches were comfy. The kitchen was well equipped and even had an ice maker appliance built under one of the cabinets. I loved the granite countertops and the space. One morning our dads combined forces and made us a yummy breakfast. Other than that, we just snacked. We dined out more.</p>

<p>The game room and movie room were decorated with fun art, including a <em>Gone with the Wind</em> movie poster.</p>

<p>A lot of time was spent playing pool and arcade games. The arcade machine had lots of different vintage games and use was unlimited. The boys (and everyone else) couldn&#8217;t stay away from it! We turned on the fireplace a few times. It was really cozy.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, we didn&#8217;t really use the theater room. It had it&#8217;s own bathroom and was such a cool thing to have in the cabin. We all love movies, but we were pretty busy seeing the sights. One night we just watched TV down there before bed. The sound system was good and the picture clear. (Love that <em>Grease</em> poster).</p>

<h3>Wednesday, May 27th: Poison Ivy Scare &amp; Dixie Stampede</h3>
<p>Every morning Dustin and I would wake up and try to get some work in. On Wednesday, Dustin was breaking out in poison ivy. We were unsure of how bad it was until his eyes began to swell. After a trip to Urgent Care and $200+ in medical bills, we were glad we paid attention. I guess Dustin is extremely allergic to poison ivy and it had gotten into his bloodstream. The doctor at Urgent Care gave him a shot and watched him until his swelling went down. His tongue was tingling and his lips were swollen. The doctor told us if it got any worse he needed to get to the ER. She gave us directions, but with steroids he got a little better.</p>
<p>That evening we got to go to <a href="http://www.dixiestampede.com/pigeon-forge?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Dixie Stampede</a>. Was it corny? A little. Was it fun? YES! I&#8217;ve been three times now and I love it. Headed up by Dolly Parton, this attraction is fun for all ages and includes a full meal. You eat with your hands &#8220;country style&#8221; and watch a show. There are live animals like horses, pigs, mini ponies, bison, and more. The tricks are cool and they&#8217;ve added a woman who flies around attached to invisible cords, representing a Native American bird. The service was great and our waiter took good care of us, making sure we had lots of sweet tea.</p>
<p>I was so full at the end. The <a href="http://www.dixiestampede.com/pigeon-forge/four-course-dinner?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">amount of food</a> is so big. You get a cheesy roll, a bowl of creamy vegetable soup, half a baked potato, a whole chicken, BBQ pork loin, corn-on-the-cob, and an apple turnover. The chicken is really strange (because it&#8217;s an entire chicken) when they lay it on your plate, but it&#8217;s delicious. There are wet wipes for your hands too.</p>
<p>For $60, it&#8217;s a bit of a splurge, but it was fun for the whole family and the horse  tricks were worth seeing. Look around for coupons!</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s enough of our trip for this post. (And that&#8217;s only three days!) Next, we had a few more days with the family and then headed off on our own.</p>

<p>A few months ago Dustin and I were both feeling jittery and wanted to travel. <strong>Unfortunately our car wasn&#8217;t really reliable and Dustin couldn&#8217;t take any time off work.</strong> As I sat at my desk looking longingly at <a href="https://www.groupon.com/getaways?utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_campaign=US_DT_SEA_GGL_TXT_GET_SR_CBP_CHG_YBR_k*groupon%20getaways_m*e_d*USA-Getaways_g*Groupon-Getaways-Exact_c*76830201640_sp*g&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Groupon Getaways</a>, I realized we would have to wait quite awhile until we could go on a trip just the two of us. Then, both sets of parents offered us opportunities we couldn&#8217;t decline!</p>
<p>First, my mum and stepdad were headed to Myrtle Beach at the beginning of May. They invited us to come with them. Since our car couldn&#8217;t make the trip (probably)** we rode with them and spent five nights right on the beach. It was relaxing, even though we both worked during the trip.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s the beauty of working from home&#8230;you can work from anywhere! </strong></p>
<p>We ate a lot of delicious food and I&#8217;m pretty sure I inhaled 30+ hushpuppies all by myself. I hadn&#8217;t launched the blog yet and wasn&#8217;t taking a lot of photos BUT I&#8217;m thinking I might go back and write about a few of the places we got to visit.</p>
<p>Right before the trip to Myrtle Beach, Dustin&#8217;s parents invited us to go to Gatlinburg, Tennessee with them. I adore the mountains and have grown up going to North Carolina multiple times a year to visit family.</p>
<p>They hadn&#8217;t ever been there (gasp!)</p>
<p>Without hesitation we told them we would love to go. Later, my dad hopped on board and we all planned three nights in the mountains together. Now, I love spending time with family. BUT Dustin and I also wanted to take advantage of already being down South. I worked extra hard and saved enough money for us to stay at bed and breakfasts three extra nights to extend our vacation. Again, we had to work the whole time, but it was worth every second to be able to get away from home.</p>
<p><em>**Right before the trip I was out with some girlfriends. My mum dropped me off at Starbucks after we&#8217;d been carpooling. I put my  keys in the ignition and<strong> the car wouldn&#8217;t go.</strong> After reaching out for help and trying to jump the car, we had to leave it there. Our car, which Dustin has had since he was in high school, had officially died. It was stressful because we were leaving for Tennessee within a few days and didn&#8217;t have a working car. We had also already paid for the bed and breakfasts ahead of time. After a lot of prayer and decisions we ended up purchasing a brand new car. This was a crazy situation for us. We&#8217;ve never thought we&#8217;d purchase a new car. So, I plan on writing about the situation later. The point is, we in fact, had a vehicle for our trip. This made it extremely more enjoyable and a special time. </em></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of our entire trip. In the next few posts I&#8217;ll be elaborating on each leg of our road trip down South!</p>

<h4><strong>Monday, May 25th:</strong></h4>
<p>We left in the morning and drove to Knoxville, Tennessee. While on the way, we stopped at <a href="http://parks.ky.gov/parks/resortparks/Cumberland-falls/default.aspx?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Cumberland Falls</a>. The falls is located in Kentucky and is known around the world for it&#8217;s moonbow, a rainbow which can be seem under a full moon.</p>
<h4><strong>Tuesday, May 26th:</strong></h4>
<p>We drove into the Smokey Mountains. Visited the Welcome Center, hiked to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/laurel-falls.htm?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Laurel Falls</a>, and checked out <a href="http://visitcherokeenc.com/#home?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Cherokee, North Carolina</a>. This was also our first night at our cabin. The cabin was massive. It had a game room with a pool table and arcade, four rooms, six bathrooms, four decks, a theatre room, and a hot tub. I&#8217;ll be writing more about it in an <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/gatlinburg-with-family-hikingpigeonforgepoisonivythedixielandstampede/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">individual post</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Wednesday, May 27th:</strong></h4>
<p>Dustin got poison ivy. We ended up at Urgent Care. No matter, we still went to the <a href="http://www.dixiestampede.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Dixie Stampede</a> in the evening.</p>

<h4><strong>Thursday, May 28th:</strong></h4>
<p>This was a busy day. We visited the <a href="http://www.ripleys.com/gatlinburg/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Ripley&#8217;s Believe It Or Not Aquarium</a>,  walked downtown Gatlinburg, rode the <a href="http://obergatlinburg.com/aerial-tramway/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Ober Gatlinburg Aerial Tramway</a>, and ate at <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Old Mill</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Friday, May 29th:</strong></h4>
<p>After saying farewell to the  family, we rode an alpine roller coaster (crazy) and worked for the afternoon at Starbucks.</p>
<p>We drove about an hour and a half to Waynesville, North Carolina. Here we checked into our room at <a href="http://www.theyellowhouse.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Yellow House Bed and Breakfast</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/theyellowhousebandbfromroad.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-528" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/theyellowhousebandbfromroad-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhousebandbfromroad" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/theyellowhousebandbfromroad.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/theyellowhousebandbfromroad-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/theyellowhousebandbfromroad-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/theyellowhousebandbfromroad-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>This stay deserves its on individual post and more pictures!

<h4><strong>Saturday, May 30th:</strong></h4>
<p>We woke up and found a fun coffee shop to work at in Asheville, North Carolina. After working we headed over to<a href="http://www.biltmore.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank"> The Biltmore</a>, the largest privately owned home in the United States. It took us the entire day to explore the home and grounds. It was one of the coolest things I&#8217;ve done.

<h4><strong>Sunday, May 31st:</strong></h4>
<p>After enjoying another delicious breakfast at The Yellow House, we left and headed back to Pigeon Forge. We purchased tickets for a <del>terrifying</del> <a href="http://www.skyhighairtours.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">bi-plane ride</a>. We rode with a pilot that had explored the world. In the short amount of time we talked with him, we learned he had lived on a boat, owned a post card store, lived currently in Key West, and that he had restored this vintage plane himself!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let this smiling picture fool you&#8230;I was kinda about to pee my dress.</p>

<p>Riding on the bi-plane was amazing. Hold tight for more pictures and a more detailed account of the ride!</p>

<p>Later in the evening we headed to another bed and breakfast. Unfortunately this one wasn&#8217;t really that great. For many reasons, which I&#8217;ll hit on later, it was kinda a bummer.</p>
<p>BUT, there were puppies there! Here&#8217;s a picture!</p>

<h4><strong>Monday, June 1st:</strong></h4>
<p>We ended up stopping to work at another coffee shop on our way back, we also decided to stay another night in a hotel to break up the driving and swim in the pool.</p>
<p>So, there&#8217;s the overview. Keep tuned into Poeticlaughter for more pictures and details of the journey. Have you been to Gatlinburg? What&#8217;s you&#8217;re go-to thing to do there?</p>
<h4>Also, since we were driving a lot, we ate a lot of road trip snacks. I munched on goldfish, luna protein bars (cookie dough), and bananas. What are you&#8217;re go-to snacks for on the road?</h4>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>
