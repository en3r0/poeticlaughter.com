<p>We began overnight continuous feeds recently and it&#8217;s been such a game changer! Isabella has trouble gaining weight and was once slapped with the terrible diagnosis of &#8220;failure to thrive.&#8221; There are many reasons why she can&#8217;t eat by mouth, but for this post I&#8217;ll focus in on what an overnight continuous feed looks like for us. </p>

<p>I absolutely love the cute Honest Company diapers with the apples. We haven&#8217;t been able to share the wonder and beauty of Fall with Bella outside, but have decorated and used fun Fall things around the house&#8230;like these diapers.</p>



<h2>Getting Bella Ready For Bed </h2>



<p>Before bed, we put Bella in her pajamas and hook her up to her extension set. (I read it was best to attach the tubing to her diaper. I&#8217;ve gone away from that because we change her diaper throughout the night.) What you see here is her Mini One Feeding Tube attached to her extension set. We then give meds and her feed through the extension. The extension is good for an entire week. The feeding bag, which is filled with formula and attaches to the pump, is only good for 24hrs. (Yes, we throw away a pump bag and tubing every single day. It&#8217;s a crazy amount of waste). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-2395" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1174w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1174px) 100vw, 1174px" />
<figcaption>Trying overnight feeds the first time</figcaption>
</figure>



<h2>The First Night</h2>



<p>For the first night I had Bella sleep right next to me. I was very nervous about her strangling herself, pulling her button out, or vomiting and choking/aspirating. Here you can see Bella is hooked up to the pump tubing, IV pole, and extension set. It went amazingly. She didn&#8217;t even vomit! I woke up a lot of check on her but she seemed so happy and content. When I woke up I realized I had gotten SO MUCH SLEEP and so had she. It was crazy. I&#8217;m used to only getting 5 hours, interrupted. To switch to 8 hours was a massive blessing.</p>



<h2>Why Do Overnight Feeds Help Isabella?</h2>



<p>Overnight continuous feeds work well because Isabella has GERD (severe acid reflux) and a premature GI system. She is unable to take large volumes of formula at a time via feeding tube without throwing it up or being in pain. The goal of a continuous feed is to ensure she gets the nutrition she needs. The hope is that the very tiny amount of volume she gets per minute will be tolerated well and she will be less likely to vomit with less in her stomach. It also helps that she can rest uninterrupted. </p>



<p>Of course this is an added bonus to us! We have been on a &#8220;newborn&#8221; schedule until now (7 months) and her feeds were taking us a minimum of an hour and a half. We would need to hold her upright for an hour during the feed and then another 30 minutes to help prevent vomiting. Even then she would throw up quite a lot. To be completely honest we would bring ice packs to bed with us while feeding her to stay awake. We would blare our TV and talk to each other or watch movies. We couldn&#8217;t fall asleep during her feeds and it was very exhausting. At the time when her vomiting was at its worst we were feeding her 8x a day. To do the feed, hold her, prep the pump, etc, it was 2 hours each time. We literally spent 16 hours a day feeding Bella. </p>

</figure>



<h2>Setting Bella&#8217;s Pump, How Does It Work?</h2>



<p>The pump can be set for different rates and amounts of volume for her to receive. For Bella, we give her 30ml of a specific formula custom for her every hour. That&#8217;s 1/2 an ounce an hour. Or, 1/2ml per minute. It&#8217;s basically like an IV drip, only with formula. We allow this to run from 10pm until 9am. The formula is good to be hung for 4 hours. We wake up 2x to refill the pump bag with fresh formula mixed up and prepped in the fridge. </p>

</figure>



<h2>Why Do You Wake Up?</h2>



<p>We wake up at 2am and 6am. At this time we rewarm a bottle and add the liquid to the pump bag. We also check on Bella&#8217;s tubing, change her diaper, and check for leaking. At 2am I also give her a medication that I push through her tubing with a syringe. At 9am (or later if she&#8217;s still sleeping and we can squeeze a bit extra formula in) her alarm on her pump will sound and I will turn it off. The alarm sounds if the bag is empty, but we set our own alarms. We certainly don&#8217;t want to forget to refill the bag or else the pump will pump air into her belly! That can be very painful for a little one. Above you can see that her Gtube sometimes leaks. We have to change her outfit and sheets when this happens. </p>

<h2>Does She Still Eat During The Day?</h2>



<p>Yes! Bella still gets fed 3x during the day. We give her 75ml over an hour at 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm. She gets a little over 1ml an hour. She tolerates it rather well and usually just naps during the 12pm and 4pm feed on my chest. I still have to hold her upright for an hour and a half. Then, at the 8pm feed she falls asleep and stays asleep for the rest of the night. Of course we accidentally wake her to take her to bed and &#8220;hook her up&#8221; but she usually just groggily smiles and then falls back asleep.</p>

<figcaption>Mommy and Me Time!</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>I love feeding Bella. It&#8217;s a very special time. She snuggles up and I have an hour and a half to just be cozy with her. In the beginning I had to do this A LOT (8x a day shared with Dustin). That made it hard to do anything, including making insurance calls and eat. Now it&#8217;s only 2x a day and Dustin does 1. This 3 hours is helpful to slow down and rest. Above is my setup for Bella&#8217;s feeds. I&#8217;m tethered to her and her pump so I make sure to empty my bladder, get anything I want nearby and get comfy! I just finished a fun book called Girl Wash Your Face. </p>

<h2>Overnight Feeding Has It&#8217;s Challenges</h2>



<p>So, sleeping almost all night and not waking up every few hours is amazing. It&#8217;s so crazy awesome. BUT, there are some challenges with overnight feeds.</p>



<p>Bella moves around a lot and can pull on her button.</p>



<p>We alter her sleepers if they don&#8217;t have snaps by cutting a hole in them for the tubing. I run these down her leg to help keep her from tugging on the tubing or getting it caught around her neck. It&#8217;s actually pretty hard to find a ton of snap sleepers that are warm! So, we use zipper ones and just alter them ourselves. </p>



<p>We just recently began running the tubing through an empty paper towel roll to help keep it from away her head.</p>



<p>Sometimes if the button is pulled she leaks all over herself and the bed. We have to change out her clothing and the bedding. </p>



<p>The friction on her button causes her to break out. She can get skin breakdown near her stoma (stomach hole). So we have to keep bandages on it and rash cream to keep it from bleeding. </p>



<p>Sometimes I worry about her silently aspirating the formula into her lungs. If she does it silently after vomiting, I have no way of knowing or stopping the pump if I&#8217;m asleep. I&#8217;ve had to simply give this fear to God and trust that Bella is big enough to turn her head and spit formula out. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-2434" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" />

</figure>



<h2>Overall, It&#8217;s the Right Choice For Bella </h2>



<p>Continuous overnight feeds has certainly helped Bella so much. She still vomits at least once during the night or morning, but it&#8217;s not a lot of formula! Sometimes she&#8217;ll go all night not vomiting and will simply wake up throwing up a small volume! I don&#8217;t even have to change her bedding. For us, this is awesome. She was throwing up 5+ times a night before and not gaining the weight she desperately needed. Now, she seems to be hitting new milestones and seems to rested. We&#8217;ve put off continuous feeds during the day, to keep her from being hooked up all the time, and hope we can keep avoiding it by doing this. We can also avoid certain medications to empty her stomach quicker and a GJ tube which puts formula into her small intestine! </p>

<p>Also, note, our bed is made! Thanks to the extra sleep I was getting. I can&#8217;t remember when I took the above pictures, but you better believe the bed is made now almost every day thanks to the restful night and clean bedding with no throw up! </p>

<h2>How Are Things?</h2>
<p>Yesterday (as I edit this, 2 days ago) Isabella turned 7 months old! This is such a crazy milestone! We are over 1/2 way through her first year. We spent her first 3 1/2 months in the NICU and have been able to celebrate 4, 5, 6, and now 7 at home! When your child is medically fragile or had a rough start to life, you celebrate every milestone possible!</p>
<p>So, where are things? How is Isabella doing? I get this question (as does everyone who knows Bella well) asked often. It&#8217;s a hard question to answer. The answer isn&#8217;t necessarily &#8220;bad&#8221; but it&#8217;s not quite &#8220;great.&#8221; I usually say she&#8217;s a very happy and content baby. She loves life and is growing. Then I say that she is struggling with excessive vomiting and that there are some health concerns. This is a great summary. It&#8217;s kind of like &#8220;Thank you for asking! We&#8217;re OK. She&#8217;s OK. Life is so great at home. But, please don&#8217;t leave me off your prayer list yet. We&#8217;re still in it. We&#8217;re living and loving it but also struggling sometimes.&#8221; I don&#8217;t typically even begin to explain the stress of the hour-to-two-hour feeds, the unending  vomit laundry, the financial stress, the lack of sleep, or grieving  not being able to have more children. But I&#8217;m so thankful and happy and grateful. It&#8217;s a mixed bag of emotions.</p>

<h2>Making Myself Post An Update</h2>
<p class="p1">I had a few minutes to write today. 30 to be exact. As I look up at the clock I see that Bella’s next feed begins at 7:00pm. She’s playing peacefully in her rock n’ play with her turtle toy, wrapped up in a pretty crocheted pink blanket.</p>
<p class="p1">I didn’t want to write. Even though I know I always feel better and I know others want to know how Bella’s evaluation went…I’d rather lay back on the couch. I pulled up my blog and it didn’t come up. Probably some simple technical error Dustin will fix when we gets home from having coffee with a good friend.</p>
<p class="p1">It seems as if there’s a million reasons to NOT write, but I realize and have been inspired by a book (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Wash-Your-Face-Believing-ebook/dp/B072TMB75T?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Girl Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis</a>) I’m reading to push through the roadblocks and make this a priority. That being said, Bella’s beginning to screech a bit so my 30 minutes may be less.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Let’s jump right in!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0863-e1538529121438.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2351" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0863-e1538529121438-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0863-e1538529121438-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0863-e1538529121438-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0863-e1538529121438-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<h2>NICU Established Pediatric Development Assessment</h2>
<p class="p1">Yesterday we headed up to Akron as a family! Dustin usually has to work but decided to take the day off since it was a bigger day than usual and we had Bella’s Neonatal Follow-Up Clinic.</p>
<p class="p1">The night before and morning were ROUGH. Bella vomitted<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>so much on the way there, soaking her sleeper and causing her to cough and retch. It was really heartbreaking. She finally fell asleep as we jumped on the highway. The sun didn’t come up until we began to reach Akron. Each of us were lucky to get 4 hours of sleep. We ate Burger King breakfast and drank coffee. I tried not to nod off in the back seat with Bella. We couldn’t find anything good on the radio either.</p>
<p class="p1">First up was Bella’s feed. We got unloaded and headed into Akron Children’s Hospital. Bella needed her feed before her appointment so we were there early. While signing in, we got to run into one of our primary nurses, Jackie, who took our family on when Bella was only 3 days old! I was so embarrassed Bella (and us) looked like a hot mess, but she was so encouraging and loved seeing how chubby Bella has become. Also, she’s pregnant! Her little one is passed the gestational age of Bella when she met her. Crazy!</p>
<p class="p1">Next, we sleepily headed up to the floor and began prepping her feed. We all went into the family bathroom and I also changed her into a cute outfit. Bella was hungry. Surprisingly the nurses came out after we got her feed ready and said they could put us in a room and get her ready for the appointment! How great! So we ended up getting in right away. We saw a nurse that did Bella’s weight and vitals and then another nurse that did a full interview about Bella and her health.</p>
<p class="p1">We had begun her feed but warned the nurses of her vomiting. After she’d gotten some food, we held her and the nurse began her testing. Holding a colored ring in front of her, tracking her eyes, etc. At this point Bella began projectile vomiting over the office. She was retching and lost her whole feed. Dustin’s on the floor trying to mop up the puddles of vomit and I’m soaked and trying to catch it in a burp cloth. The nurse looked shocked. She asked “is this what it’s like all the time?” We nodded and I began to cry. Of course it was agreed upon that we needed to continue testing and solving this massive issue. The vomiting aside, things went great!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0867-e1538529560943.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2352" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0867-e1538529560943-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0867-e1538529560943-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0867-e1538529560943-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0867-e1538529560943-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">We got Bella cleaned up (and myself a bit) and prepared for the doctor. Doctor Langkamp came in and was super friendly. She had another doctor that was learning with her. She immediately took to Bella and Bella soaked up the attention. Laying on the exam table, Isabella was tested in different ways. The doctor held her up, checked her reflexes, checked her eyes, busted out colored toys to Bella’s delight and “talked” with her as she<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>babbled and cooed.</p>
<p class="p1">She asked us if we had any concerns.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Yes. A Million.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I tried to think back to my list and zero in on the most important things.</p>
<p class="p1">Question: The vomiting. Could this be an underlying syndrome? Something like a bigger disorder. Answer: That’s highly unlikely.</p>
<p class="p1">Question: Her ears (one is folded over). Could this be a sign of a genetic issue? Answer: Probably not, no. But you’re past the time for a quick fix. She’d probably need surgery…I responded that we didn’t mind it. I actually find it cute. We just wanted to make sure it wasn’t an issue.</p>
<p class="p1">Question: How will we know if she has any neurological disorders? Answer: Well, we won’t really know until 12 months. We don’t typically see issues this early on. But things are looking really great and her risk is low.</p>
<p class="p1">Question: Her tongue and lip look tied. We had a referral to a dentist but that didn’t sit well with us. What are your thoughts? Answer: She can put her tongue out great. It could certainly be attached in the back, but in my years of experience this isn’t an issue at all. There’s no need to have this looked at further.</p>
<p class="p1">Question: Bella’s getting big and more active. She doesn’t want to be held during feeds but needs to sit upright or else she vomits and loses food. Any chair suggestions? Answer: Her Physical Therapists like a Fisher Price Sit Me Up Chair. (Added to my list!)</p>
<p class="p1">Question: Can you think of any other tests Gastroenterology could be doing (for the vomiting)? Answer: No. It’s not my area of expertise. They do a great job (which we agreed with), but I’m surprised she’s not on a medication to help empty her stomach quicker. We will ask about this next.</p>

<h2>The Hard Question</h2>
<p class="p1">At the end of the assessment. The doctor sat and reviewed everything with us. Of course she wanted Bella to be bigger, but she explained she was very impressed with Bella and that we were doing everything right. I’m a gold star kinda gal…so this made me feel good. <strong>Although in my mind I reminded myself that this wasn’t about US, this was about God and his mighty work in her.</strong> Although I work with Bella and try to be a good steward of my time with her and being her momma, ultimately it’s God’s mercy and love that helps Bella grow and develop. <strong>Also, if she were doing worse for wear…that wouldn’t be a direct reflection of our bad parenting or lack of faith or God’s lack of love for Bella. It’s vital to keep these things in mind when parenting a child with medical needs.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I asked the question I was most scared about again, only more directly.</p>
<p class="p1">Will Bella have any cognitive issues or delays?</p>
<p class="p1">Answer: We can’t say for sure, but things look good and I wouldn’t worry about it. Honestly, you have plenty enough to worry about. (Amen, sister. I like this lady already).</p>
<p class="p1">I probed a little bit further. She explained we probably wouldn’t see issues until about 12 months. But that things looked good. Having her have a brain MRI earlier on also gives me some confidence, too. (She had one in NICU).</p>
<p>We were referred for a (routine) hearing test with audiology (yet another specialist) and advised to keep up with GI. Dr. Langkamp said &#8220;Enjoy her, she&#8217;s a delight.&#8221; Bella kept grinning and babbling all the way out.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0882-e1538529927744.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2356" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0882-e1538529927744-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0882-e1538529927744-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0882-e1538529927744-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0882-e1538529927744-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<h2>(TLDR) A Quick Summary</h2>
<p>Isabella impressed the Pediatric Development Doctor. She is still small and is in the less than 1% for her age but she is making excellent progress in developments. The doctor loved how interactive she was and seemed really affirmative. Later, we received a letter said she scored a 9/11 for the<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article/26/1/33/893255?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"> Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental Screening</a>. This puts her at low to moderate risk. She was able to do a lot of the activities but struggled to sit with slight support for 10 seconds and had no interest in their white little pellet.</p>
<p>In the doctor&#8217;s own words:</p>
<div>&#8220;Medical Decision Making: Isabella is a former 27 week gestation preterm infant who has shown excellent progress in development. Developmentally, she is functioning at an appropriate level for her age adjusted for prematurity. With respect to her chronologic age, she shows delays in milestones. She is making slow progress in growth and continues to have frequent emesis and GERD. I recommend that she continue with GI and nutrition for further management of her growth. I do not recommend starting oral feeds at this time. I recommend having her upright in a high chair at the table when her family is eating. We discussed possible use of Fisher Price Sit-Me-Up floor seat. She will be due for hearing test in 3 months.&#8221;</div>
<div><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0817.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-2349 aligncenter" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0817.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="384" height="512" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0817.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 384w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0817-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>Diagnosis:</div>
<div>1. Delay in milestones</div>
<div>2. Dysphagia/ g-tube dependent/ GERD</div>
<div>3. Extreme prematurity</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently Bella sees:</p>
<p>A: Primary Pediatrician -Pediatric Dermatologist -Eye Doctor &#8211; Audiologist  &#8211; Speech Therapist &#8211; Dietician &#8211; Developmental Pediatric Doctor &#8211; Surgeon &#8211; GI Specialist</p>
<p>At birth she was 1 lb 7 ounces. Yesterday she was over 10 1/2 lbs!</p>
<p>Her BMI is 14.97 and is in the 9th percentile! (She&#8217;s proportionate!)</p>
<p>Her weight, head circumference and height are all in the less than 1%.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0872.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2353" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0872-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0872-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0872-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0872-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0872-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>So, there&#8217;s the current update.</p>
<p>We actually headed over to Pediatric Dermatology after for a general follow-up &#8230;but that&#8217;s an update for another day.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining in the crazy. We love you,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>One of the greatest gifts we&#8217;ve received are professional photographs taken in the NICU. These were taken while Bella was only 14 days old. I remember signing up so excitedly on the paper sign up sheet in the family lounge and then crying when I realized she would have her cpap (breathing help/mask thing) on. I walked back up and began crossing our names off the list. But Dustin looked at me and said &#8220;Tiffany, we want these pictures. We have nothing to be embarrassed about. This is her right now. This is her journey.&#8221; It&#8217;s true! I&#8217;m so glad we didn&#8217;t wait until she looked &#8220;ideal&#8221; to take these photos. This was us. This was her. This was our reality.</p>

<p>But of course I struggled when I looked down at her and the photographer walked into the room. I even asked the nurses if we could sneak the cpap off for a few photos. (So silly of me). I was still very much overwhelmed and in a lot of pain from my emergency c-section. I was also pumping like crazy, living in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, taking pain killers, taking blood pressure medication, and trying to be a mom. It was one of the hardest times of my life yet it was filled with so much peace and joy. I believe that this is reflected in these photos.</p>

<p>To be honest, I almost didn&#8217;t want anyone to see these. Bella looks&#8230;scary. Kind of like an animal. She doesn&#8217;t really look like the cuddly baby you imagine or see in pictures. BUT we loved her all the same and I held onto hope that she would grow and develop into a beautiful little one&#8230;and God didn&#8217;t put that hope to shame!</p>

<p>Looking back, I carefully curated things I shared with the world. Dustin and I always wanted the way we presented our story to be a story of hope and love. We wanted Bella to be able to look back and be proud of how we shared her journey. I believe we have been good stewards of this. Some questioned early on&#8230;including us&#8230;if we should share so transparently about our journey. I know it&#8217;s not for everyone&#8230;and not everyone is called to it&#8230;but we felt we were called by the Lord to share Isabella with everyone in a public way.</p>

<p>From the day years ago that God told me I&#8217;d have a daughter and to name her Isabella Melody we&#8217;ve known she would be used greatly in His Kingdom.</p>

<p>So, I share these photographs to inspire others and give them a HOPE. You probably are looking up viability of a 27 weeker or maybe you are in the NICU and hope your baby will look a bit different as the month go on. (They will).</p>

<p>Isabella was born at 27 weeks but only weighed 1 lb 7 ounces due to restricted growth. I had an emergency cesarean that I was put under for since I had severe preeclampsia and stage 2 HELLP Syndrome that threatened my life.</p>

<p>If you notice the shock and awe of this image&#8230;it&#8217;s because this was the very first time I held Bella cradled in my arms and without doing skin to skin! For 14 days I had only held her chest to chest and while doing kangaroo care (skin to skin).</p>

<p>As the days passed her coloring got better, she grew, and medical devices and medications were slowly taken away. Now, she is 6 months old and doing great. She has a feeding tube due to silent aspiration but other than that she is a healthy, happy baby.</p>

<p>If you look closely you can see the strange white hair that covered her entire little body. This is called lanugo and went away after awhile. She was very fragile at this time to we used help getting her out of the isolette and she wasn&#8217;t moved around too much.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have to post more about this information, but she doesn&#8217;t have clothing on because she was in a controlled warm isolette and she needed to be seen by nurses/doctors. As she grew she could wear clothing&#8230;around 1 month or so.</p>
<p>I want to thank Simon Says Smile for this amazing gift to us. This is a volunteer program offered through <a href="http://www.blackdogphotoco.com/index.html/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Black Dog Photo Co.</a> They came and did this photo shoot free of charge. (AND later helped us when we accidentally overrode these pictures). AMAZING people.</p>
<p>Lastly, we had another amazing photo shoot done by Teresa Young. She also gifted these amazing photos to us. This was a very emotional moment as I had dreamed of some &#8220;normal&#8221; looking images of my tribe. Here&#8217;s a little teaser and I&#8217;ll post the rest another time.</p>

<p>It seems like just yesterday that we left the NICU at <a href="https://www.akronchildrens.org/For-Families-Patients.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital</a>. I have very many mixed memories of that place. Some of the scariest times of my life happened behind those walls and some of the happiest.</p>
<p>In the midst of a dark time we did our best to make the NICU home. Years ago I bought an art print that says, &#8220;Home is wherever I&#8217;m with you.&#8221; (Yes, it was bought from Urban Outfitters and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHEOF_rcND8&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros</a> were popular&#8230;ok now listening to them on repeat).</p>
<p>Since our marriage, Dustin and I have moved six times. It&#8217;s funny to add &#8220;NICU&#8221; to that list. We spent most nights there but spent 17 at <a href="http://rmhakron.org/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Ronald McDonald House</a> and once a week at home to rest up. I plan on writing a lot more about making the NICU home and our experiences there. In the meantime, enjoy this video I took near the end of our stay. You can tell Bella is much more stable and is even in an open cot!</p>
<p>XOXO</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>(Of course I&#8217;m just posting this. So, the date this was written was a bit ago and the dates we were in the ER were August 2nd and July 26th)</p>
<p>Thankfully, we were not in the ER today. But, we spent time there twice within the last two weeks, one week apart exactly. Why? You ask? Because Isabellas <a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/g-tube.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Gtube</a> keeps falling out!</p>
<p>For me, blogging has been very therapeutic and helps me get my thoughts organized. Having a daughter with numerous health issues is overwhelming. One of the things I found when we lived in the NICU is that there are lots of resources about preemies but not many about G tube&#8217;s. So, I decided to begin blogging about her G-tube journey so that other moms might find it useful. This is also a great way to keep family and friends updated.</p>
<h2>The Dreaded Day Bella&#8217;s Feeding Tube Fell Out</h2>
<p>Bella has a G-tube and we were trained on it in the NICU. I felt pretty confident about things except for replacing the button at home. I knew it would just take some getting used to. But I&#8217;m quite squeamish and looking into a hole in your baby&#8217;s stomach can certainly freak you out. We&#8217;ve become quite comfortable with this little button. We do hook up to feeds eight times a day. So, when her feeding tube did fall out we were prepared.</p>
<p>It was during her for 4:30pm feed. I noticed Isabellas button looked loose. We were going to vent her which basically means let air out of her belly. She was crying and the button was being pushed out. This is pretty normal so I didn&#8217;t think much of it. When she cries the pressure in her stomach can push the button out. It&#8217;s not really something to be scared about. I mentioned it to Dustin who was with me. He didn&#8217;t think it was anything to worry about and continued hooking her extension to the button. I thought maybe I was being overdramatic and looked away for a second while he hooked her up. Before I knew it I heard him yelp and I looked down and the extension was attached to the button and the button was completely out of her stomach.</p>
<p>I looked down and saw the hole and immediately remembered what to do. Dustin ran and grabbed the emergency kit while I held pressure on the stoma (medical term for hole). Luckily Isabella hadn&#8217;t eaten for awhile so the stomach contents weren&#8217;t pouring out. She was unhappy but didn&#8217;t seem to be in pain. There was a little blood from her granulation tissue but nothing crazy.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2177" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9087.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2177 size-shareaholic-thumbnail" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9087-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9087-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9087-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9087.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bella sleeps on the way up to Akron. You can see the catheter hanging out on her side.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Dustin came in with the emergency kit in his hand. We prepare emergency kits with catheters in them in case the button falls out. It is a short-term fix to keep the hole open until we get to a surgeon who will replace it in the emergency department. Eventually we can switch out the button ourselves but since the hole is still healing, our surgeon instructed us to bring her to the emergency department at Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital. He told us the hole could close within 30 minutes and that it would be painful for them to reopen it. So there certainly is urgency in getting something in the hole to keep it open. There are only three people who are supposed to be able to change the button,  Dr Pittinger his partner, Dr. Andrews, or their surgical resident.</p>
<p>Dustin took the catheter and put a small amount of lube on the ends and inserted it into her hole then using a syringe we filled the end, which is like a balloon, with a measured amount of water to hold it in place. Once we made sure the amount of water was correctly in, I taped gauze around it and attached it to Isabellas shirt to keep it from pulling out.</p>
<p>Dustin ran downstairs to our office in the basement, (he works from home) and told his coworkers he would have to leave for the day. We are really lucky this happened near the end of the night so he didn&#8217;t have to miss a lot of work. We packed everything we needed to drive Akron Children&#8217;s Emergency Department which is an hour and a half away. I made sure we had formula, extra syringes, extra extensions, and all her medications.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2178" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9090.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2178 size-shareaholic-thumbnail" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9090-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9090-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9090-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9090.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Waiting for a short minute in the ER</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>We placed her in her carseat and used a button down to pull the extension out and lay it gently beside her. The ride to Akron was pretty uneventful and she actually slept away. She was getting hungry because she didn&#8217;t get her feed. She doesn&#8217;t take anything by mouth so if her G-tube is out we can&#8217;t give her food or her medications. We called family and I also contacted a friend who is bringing us dinner. We told her to still bring it and Dustin&#8217;s parents would pick it up and put it in the house for us. They were already planning on being over because they have been mowing our lawn for us!  On the way I called the Emergency Department and told them about Isabella and they contacted Dr Pittinger and his surgical resident. We explained Isabella was medically fragile and they said they would be ready for us when we arrived.</p>

<h2>Why&#8217;d It Fall Out?</h2>
<p>The feeding button fell out because the balloon holding it inside of Bella&#8217;s tummy deflated. This can happen if the button is old, punctured, or if the water is evaporating. To be honest we&#8217;re not sure why Bella&#8217;s button deflated completely. We asked the surgeon and they don&#8217;t know either. This was frustrating, but we were happy to know she had a new button in.</p>

<h2>Best Emergency Department Visit Ever</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s strange going back to Akron Children&#8217;s Emergency Department because we lived in the same building for over 100 days. The NICU is on the sixth and seventh floor. When we staying in Isabellas room up there, I remember countless hours staring out at the city and listening to the ambulances go in and out from the Emergency Department. We knew the area like the back of her hand. We walked into the Emergency Department and as soon as we said her name we were ushered back quickly into a room where they did an intake on Bella. Then they took us to a private room and the surgeon walked in with in six minutes. They ordered as a new button change kit,  even though we had our own (which saved time). It was nice that they moved so urgently.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2181" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9093.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2181 size-shareaholic-thumbnail" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9093-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9093-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9093-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9093.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Isabella lays on the hospital bed, waiting with the catheter in for her button to be replaced. You can see the red marks where the tape was pulled off. Here she has her catheter in.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>All the while, Bella was getting pretty hungry. The resident walked in, sterilized, gloved up, asked  a few questions and began assessing Bella. He asked if we wanted to put it back in, but we said no. I felt it was too far away from the official &#8220;heal&#8221; date of August 22nd. I also felt that if there was something wrong he would be able to tell. Within a few quick minutes he pulled the catheter out and inserted the new MiniOne button. Bella cried a bit when he accidentally tugged on the catheter, not realizing it was inflated inside her stomach (rolls eyes).</p>
<p>It was a quick quick thing. The button is inserted and then filled with water to keep it in place inside her stomach. You have to measure the water correctly so that you know how much is inflated inside of her. For Bella, her balloon takes 2.5mls. After awhile you memorize it and know to check it to make sure it has the right amount. Isabella doesn&#8217;t seem to be in pain during the change and was just annoyed someone was bugging her and hungry. As soon as we go the new button in, the surgeon made sure it the placement was correct by pushing fluid in and taking it out of the tubing.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2182" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9095.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2182 size-shareaholic-thumbnail" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9095-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9095-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9095-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9095.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Up close look at Bella&#8217;s stoma (medical term for hole). You can see the fluid and granulation tissue.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>We were able to stay in the private room to feed Bella. To feed her on the go, or in this case, an emergency, we put her speciality formula into a 60ml syringe and attach it to her extension cord. We then push the formula into her stomach slowly. She doesn&#8217;t tolerate this well and usually throws up. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t have time to fully pack the pump.</p>

<h2>They Know Us</h2>
<p>We were exhausted. We ran out of the house in a rush and were hitting the wall. We were so glad the ER visit took so little time and we were home before 9:00pm, but we were hungry. We walked in and saw a gift bag for us. Our friends Molly and Anthony Pingitore and their precious girls had prepared us dinner. We had a delicious chicken casserole, salad, cookie dough and green beans! While we prepared to feed Bella again we opened the sweetest card from them. Dustin and I both tried to hold back tears. It said lovely things and also had gifts for us. A gift card to Sephora for me and a gift card to Chipotle for Dustin.</p>

<p>We fell into the couch after sanitizing and digged into a delicious meal. We both prayed out loud over Bella and our family. I know Molly and Anthony provided these things but I just felt the biggest hug from God himself. Not only did he provide the necessities (dinner), he provided chocolate chip cookie dough (we each grabbed some raw) AND a special gift for each of us. This was a very thoughtful gift since money&#8217;s rather tight and I don&#8217;t just go shopping for makeup. My foundation was running low and I wanted a new lipstick for my friends wedding. God used Molly to provide such a fun &#8220;extra&#8221; gift. That&#8217;s what I love about our Jesus. He cares about the little details that make us US. Thank you Molly and Anthony for allowing the Holy Spirit to work through you and for being so generous.</p>

<p>The rest of the week we also received some amazing meals and gifts from others too! God&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p>Anyway, as soon as we took a sigh of relief, and things felt &#8220;in control&#8221; a week later to the day her button fell out again and we did the trip/process all over again. This time, though, we got some good information and (spoiler) approval to change the button out at home from now on! See Part 2!</p>
<p>I love you all,</p>
<p>XOXO Tiff</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 10:01pm here. I&#8217;m in the basement. I&#8217;m in our office writing on my computer.</p>
<p>As a busy new mom to a baby girl I should probably be showering or sleeping or brushing my teeth or working out&#8230;but I&#8217;m writing.</p>
<p>I get an itch. An itch to write my thoughts and feelings and get them out of my head.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s therapeutic and one of the things I credit for me sanity these days.</p>
<p>Times Are Rough</p>
<p>&#8230;oh, but they&#8217;re so rewarding and full of joy.</p>
<p>My Body Is Tired</p>
<p>&#8230;but I&#8217;ve never felt so alive.</p>
<p>My Head Hurts</p>
<p>&#8230;but I continue to strive to show kindness, empathy, compassion, and encouragement to my family.</p>
<p>I Feel Weak</p>
<p>&#8230;but I&#8217;ve never felt so strong (and dare I say brave?)</p>

<p>Right now I&#8217;m listening to the &#8220;Teen Party&#8221; mix on Spotify. I&#8217;m drinking out of a bright yellow cup. I threw on my floral matching pajamas. I wholeheartedly believe that what I surround myself makes a difference in my attitude and outlook on life. Bring on the bright colors. Bring on the fun teen beats.</p>

<h2>Isabella&#8217;s Reflux</h2>
<p>Isabella had a pretty good day. She&#8217;s adjusting to her new formula which is Alimentum and medication for her severe reflux. We had an appointment yesterday and she has gained an ounce a day since our last emergency appointment! This is very encouraging. We were referred to a GI specialist. That will be our next step in treating her stomach issues <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/its-not-a-bad-day-its-a-day-with-bad-things-in-it/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">(Click here to learn more about why she&#8217;s having issues).</a> She is still coughing, choking, and gagging, but she is doing it less. She still spits but not at every feed. We feel the prayers and God has been leading us to solutions. Praise Him! <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8873-e1532226139377.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2119 aligncenter" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8873-e1532226139377-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="374" height="499" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8873-e1532226139377-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8873-e1532226139377-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8873-e1532226139377-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" /></a></p>
<h2>Isabella&#8217;s Hemangioma</h2>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8886-e1532226230826.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class=" wp-image-2128 aligncenter" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8886-e1532226230826-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="475" height="633" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8886-e1532226230826-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8886-e1532226230826-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8886-e1532226230826-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></a>It&#8217;s looking worse, but we are going to Akron Children&#8217;s on Monday. Her pediatric dermatologist was amazing and called us today and ordered the new medication so that we could begin treatment on Monday. We will pick it up and bring it to his office with us. This is very nice because we were only going to go over her liver ultrasound results and talk about her care plan. We typically would have to come back to have him give her the first dose and monitor her.</p>
<p>Since we live an hour and twenty minutes away and have a bunch of other appointments, he offered to begin it on Monday. She will be given propranolol at his office and will stay there for an hour and a half to two hours to be monitored. After that we will come back a week later to adjust the dosage. From there we only need to see him once a month to adjust the dose based on her weight. I&#8217;m relieved she doesn&#8217;t need to be admitted. I&#8217;m also relieved we won&#8217;t need to travel to Akron every week! This medication will work to shrink blood vessels and will assist in shrinking her hemangioma, which is a vascular birthmark on her head. We hadn&#8217;t originally wanted to treat it, since it was only cosmetic, but as time went on it became a health concern. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/whats-on-her-head-a-hemangioma-story/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Click here</a> to learn more about it and why we&#8217;re treating it!</p>
<h2>So Many Other Things, So Little Time</h2>
<p>There are so many other things to write about and update. Bella is fed every 3 hours and Dustin and I take shifts. Her feed is hung by gravity currently and drips like an IV into her tummy. It takes about 50 minutes for 65ml to go in. We hold her during her feed. Then we have to continue holding her in an upright position. This takes a lot of time! It&#8217;s also a great time to bond with our cute lil one. We love cuddling. She typically falls asleep during her feeds. With her on my chest I browse Pinterest, Facebook, read blogs, and research things regarding her health. I see it&#8217;s almost time for her to eat again so I must run up to assist Dustin in her care.</p>
<p>Goodnight!</p>
