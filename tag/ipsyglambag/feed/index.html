<p>July&#8217;s Ipsy Glambag was just so-so. Of the five samples included I really loved the Tarte Bronzer, the gel polish, and the sea salt spray. Obviously it&#8217;s October, so we&#8217;ll make this a little shorter than usual reviews. Here&#8217;s what my bag entailed!</p>

<h3>Octavio Molina Hair La Playa Salt Spray</h3>
<p>I was excited to get try this because I can never get my hair to look beachy. It always ends up looking frizzy and not very uniform. I like the smell of this product, but it didn&#8217;t seem to add that much texture to my hair. I haven&#8217;t used it for awhile.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tartesampleipsybag.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-759" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tartesampleipsybag-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="tartesampleipsybag" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tartesampleipsybag.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tartesampleipsybag-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tartesampleipsybag-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tartesampleipsybag-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/opentartesampleipsy.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-747" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/opentartesampleipsy-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="opentartesampleipsy" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/opentartesampleipsy.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/opentartesampleipsy-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/opentartesampleipsy-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/opentartesampleipsy-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>tarte Amazonian Clay Waterproof Bronzer</h3>
<p>A lot of beauty bloggers say this is one of their Holy Grails. I liked it a lot and was surprised that it blended well on my fair skin. I&#8217;ve used it a few times on my cheeks, along my jawline and on my forehead. When I wear it, I get asked if I&#8217;ve been in the sun. Win win! This sample alone is worth $10.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/vasantisampleipsybag.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-762" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/vasantisampleipsybag-1024x920.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="vasantisampleipsybag" width="1024" height="920" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/vasantisampleipsybag.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/vasantisampleipsybag-300x270.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/vasantisampleipsybag-768x690.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/vasantisampleipsybag-30x27.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>Vasanti Cosmetics Brighten Up! Exfoliating Cleanser</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m always hesitant to try new cleansers. I&#8217;m happy with what I&#8217;m currently using so this sample will get donated.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beabombshelllipbalmipsy.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-689" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beabombshelllipbalmipsy-1024x818.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="beabombshelllipbalmipsy" width="1024" height="818" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beabombshelllipbalmipsy.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beabombshelllipbalmipsy-300x240.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beabombshelllipbalmipsy-768x614.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beabombshelllipbalmipsy-30x24.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>Be A Bombshell Cosmetics Lip Balm</h3>
<p>Be A Bombshell is kinda a throw-in for Ipsy. I&#8217;ve not found a lot of their products to work well. This lip balm is nice, but it&#8217;s very pigmented. It&#8217;s easy to get smeared on your face once it&#8217;s applied. The color was nice, but I won&#8217;t be wearing it.</p>
<h3>Aurora Gel Effect Nail Polish</h3>
<p>This polish is really pretty and was a good size! I liked the coral/orange color and received a lot of compliments on it. Now, it doesn&#8217;t stay on as long as a gel manicure, but it did go on really well and seemed to be a good quality polish. I would like to try more from this brand.</p>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<p>This month wasn&#8217;t my favorite. I liked the sample from tarte and thought the nail polish was a good addition. I&#8217;m getting tired of Be a Bombshell though. I hope I don&#8217;t get anymore products from them. What do you think?</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still catching up! I received <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=1dr1&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">June&#8217;s Ipsy bag </a>and have had the pictures waiting to be published.</p>
<h3>The bag wasn&#8217;t horrible, but it wasn&#8217;t the best bag I&#8217;ve had from them.</h3>
<p>There were about three things I really loved. To begin, the bag was an interesting material. It has &#8220;ipsy&#8221; all over it with a top orangish colored zipper closure. I personally thought it was ugly so I&#8217;ll be passing it on to someone else. The most recognizable branded item was the <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EG07BM0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00EG07BM0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=UI42YDEPDRUZGQIX&quot;&gt;Smashbox&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Photo Finish OIL-FREE Foundation Primer .25 fl. oz (DLX Travel Size) NEW!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00EG07BM0&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;">Smashbox Cosmetics Photo Finish Foundation Primer</a>. As you can see, it isn&#8217;t pictured because I used it up! The other brand I recognized was <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FSD402I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00FSD402I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=3OMMU4ZF473BVDOF&quot;&gt;Lavanila&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss The Healthy Body Butter: Pure Vanilla - 6.7 oz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00FSD402I&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;">Lavanilla</a>. I was happy to get this sample because I&#8217;ve wanted to try their lotions.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsysummerboxopen.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-725" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsysummerboxopen-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="ipsysummerboxopen" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsysummerboxopen.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsysummerboxopen-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsysummerboxopen-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsysummerboxopen-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of what I received and their values!</p>
<h3>Smashbox Cosmetics Photo Finish Foundation Primer, $8</h3>
<p>This was an exciting sample for me. I love <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DJ57GHS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00DJ57GHS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=I2KS74VFZEOLZZGB&quot;&gt;Smashbox&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Try It Kit: Halo + BB Light/Medium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00DJ57GHS&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank">Smashbox Cosmetics</a> and this primer helps your makeup stay on forever. It feels really slippery and fills in all your pores. It basically perfects your skin before putting on other layers. It&#8217;s also good for oil-prone skin like mine!</p>
<h3>Pure Vanilla The Healthy Body Butter Instant Hydration by Lavanila Laboratories, $4</h3>
<p>This sample was wonderful. The warm scent of the vanilla was really strong and it stayed on my skin. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t find it as moisturizing as I&#8217;d hoped. It didn&#8217;t seem to make my hands softer in the long run. What I do love about this brand is that it&#8217;s 100% all natural. I wouldn&#8217;t buy a full sized item, but I&#8217;d welcome more samples of other scents.</p>
<h3>tre&#8217;StiQue Mini Shadow Crayon in Kona Coffee, $10</h3>
<p>This is a brand that Ipsy has been including lately. I think this is the first item I received from them. It was OK. Nothing too spectacular. I liked the shape of the crayon and the pigmentation was alright. It&#8217;s one of those products that isn&#8217;t worth the crazy high price tag for the quality. A full size is $26. I&#8217;d rather buy shadow crayons from more established brands for that price. <strong>I haven&#8217;t used it once since June. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lavanillasampleipsy.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-733" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lavanillasampleipsy-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="lavanillasampleipsy" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lavanillasampleipsy.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lavanillasampleipsy-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lavanillasampleipsy-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lavanillasampleipsy-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>Liptitude Hydrating Lip Stain by J.Cat Beauty, $5.99</h3>
<p>When I first saw this lip color, I thought it was a throw-in and nothing special. The color looked OK, but the name, Liptitude, seemed juvenile. When I opened it, I decided to try it. The color was fantastic! My husband even said it looked great on. I think the shade I received was called <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0100SY1OW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0100SY1OW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=YWC4QK43BT63IPGZ&quot;&gt;J&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Cat Liptitude Lip Stain 115 Blow Your Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0100SY1OW&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank">Blow Your Mind</a>. My mum saw it on me and also wanted one. Eventually I noticed it did move around on my lips. The color stayed, since it&#8217;s a stain, but I had trouble keeping it in place. The formula was thick and a little messy. Since I liked the shade so much, I think I&#8217;ll try it with a clear lip liner. Overall, I liked the sample, but won&#8217;t buy it since it was a little messy and had a strange smell.</p>

<h3>BioRepublic Soothing Fiber Masks (3), $14.95</h3>
<p>Three masks! Woohoo! That&#8217;s a great &#8220;one item.&#8221; A set of three masks is valued at $14.95. In the picture there is one missing because I tried it the night I opened the bag. Overall these masks worked well. They seemed to help with my irritated skin and smelled really great. I don&#8217;t think they work as well as <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MXQEFQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004MXQEFQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=BKLMQXKPA44RWGXJ&quot;&gt;Karuna&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Clarifying + Face Mask, 0.95 fl. oz.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004MXQEFQ&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank">Karuna</a> masks or <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009GYVMAS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B009GYVMAS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=X5QV2YK55CD2BC5N&quot;&gt;GLAMGLOW&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Super-MudTM Clearing Treatment 1.2 oz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B009GYVMAS&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank">GlamGlow</a>, but they were the perfect addition for the June bag.<a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZIS507C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00ZIS507C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=ODC6QLI6ZJMB5UWH&quot;&gt;BioRepublic&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Skincare Cucumber Breeze 3 Mask Set&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00ZIS507C&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank"> BioRepublic</a> is a really interesting brand. It was developed by Americans who traveled in Asia. The website says,</p>
<p>&#8220;Not being ones to accept the status quo, Justin and Paolo immediately set out to create their own line of sheet masks, inspired by Korean products but formulated with American tastes and values. Now they’re bringing their masks to you, without parabens, sulfates, pthalates, or triclosan. 100% cruelty-free.  Dermatologist tested and totally <a title="BioRepublic SkinCare - Ingredient Safety" href="http://www.biorepublic.com/pages/ingredient-safety?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">transparent</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t tried a sheet mask yet, you should! They work really well and are inexpensive.</p>

<p>Overall I liked my bag. I don&#8217;t have a lot of complaints because I feel as if I got my $10 worth of products. I loved the masks and the primer. Did you get this bag? What have you been using since June? If you give it some time, then you learn what you really use on a regular basis and prefer!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>

<p>I received the April Glambag this past month and I was super disappointed. Even before getting it in the mail, I received an email that said that the MICA Beauty eye primer had some discoloration in it. Nonetheless, I held out, hoping the bag would still deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler Alert: It didn&#8217;t.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always heard other beauty lovers complain about their subscription purchases and I thought it was absurd. It&#8217;s cheap makeup and risk is involved&#8230;so don&#8217;t complain. Just cancel. <strong>Well, after this month I was a little more understanding. </strong>Here&#8217;s what I received in my bag, and why I can&#8217;t be too happy with it this month.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tintedlipandblushclosed.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-474" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tintedlipandblushclosed-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="tintedlipandblushclosed" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tintedlipandblushclosed.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tintedlipandblushclosed-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Mullein &amp; Sparrow All Natural Tinted Lip and Cheek Balm, Sample Size, Valued at $8</strong></p>
<p>This product had me really excited for this bag. I really like anything from Etsy sellers and love supporting small businesses. Unfortunately this product didn&#8217;t have any pigment. As you can see in the swatches, there wasn&#8217;t any color. The smell was delicious. It reminded me of citrus. Some members of Ipsy said they were going to use it as a perfume. I think this was an OK idea. Unfortunately I haven&#8217;t even reached for it since I reviewed it. The design on the front is beautiful and the concept is cool but it just didn&#8217;t work.</p>

<h3>Wind Blown 05 Dry Finishing Spray by Redken, Sample Size, Valued at $10</h3>
<p>This sample was probably my favorite item in the bag. I like Redken products and I&#8217;ve used this a few times since receiving it. The finishing spray is supposed to hold your hair and also help it look more polished. Overall it wasn&#8217;t something I&#8217;d purchase myself, but I&#8217;m glad to have it.</p>

<h3>theBalm Cosmetics Eye Shadow in Flirty, Sample valued at $1.50-$2</h3>
<p>I was bummed about the size of this sample. I like theBalm, which is sold at Ulta and other stores, but this sample was so tiny. The color was ok but I have other shades similar. The individual eye shadow comes in a magnetic little package. Of course I think the packaging is cute though.</p>

<h3>MicaBeauty Eye Primer, Sample Size, Value $12</h3>
<p>Oh, this was a big oopsidaisi from Ipsy. Right before I was mailed out my bag I received a message saying that the MicaBeauty Primer was discolored. I&#8217;m a member of an online makeup forum and many members were saying they found mold in their product. Now, Ipsy swears that it&#8217;s just discoloration but I wasn&#8217;t too confident. Once I received it I looked it over. Even though it looked alright to use, I was weary. I emailed the help desk and was responded to quickly. They told me that they understood my concern and offered another sample with its own shipping tracking code. I threw the primer away and within a week had another item in the mail. I was shocked that they sent me a <strong>full sized</strong> Oscar Blandi Pronto Texture and Volume Spray. I plan on offering a full review on this product later. I was really pleased with the quick response and customer service. This has made me more confident with my subscription and I&#8217;m super glad I haven&#8217;t cancelled.</p>

<h3>JulieG Nail Color in Damsel, Full-size $3.99</h3>
<p>The color is pretty for spring but I&#8217;m not a fan of the formula. It has formaldehyde in it, which is pretty bad for you. Now, I do use a lot of different nail polishes, some of which may not be 100% natural, but this worried me. It&#8217;s a cheaper brand from Wallgreens and I&#8217;m picky about what I put on my nails. Overall, I decided not to use this. I&#8217;ll probably give it to someone. The color is pretty though, too bad I don&#8217;t know what it looks like on.</p>

<h3>Overall: It Was the Worst Bag I&#8217;ve Ever Received</h3>
<p>I was shocked when I received this. It was the worst bag I&#8217;ve ever received from Ipsy. The bag itself was cute but the items just didn&#8217;t seem worth the price. Some people loved this bag and I think it might be a matter of preference. I won&#8217;t really use the eyeshadow, the primer, the tint, or the nail polish. I&#8217;ve used the hair product and liked it and I also used the bag when I went to the beach. It&#8217;s been a few months since I&#8217;ve taken the pictures and I still think this is a pretty bad bag&#8230;but I&#8217;m happy with the full-sized product they sent me.</p>
<p>This made me keep subscribing and of course I&#8217;ve been super happy with the products ever since.</p>

<p>A mix of lipstick, lotion, eyeshadow, and more? I&#8217;m in love with the <strong>variety</strong> and <strong>usefulness</strong> of these items.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pixibeauty.com/eyes/eyeshadow/mesmerizing-mineral-palette?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank"> Eyeshadow Duo in Apricot Glow from Pixi by Petra, $4 </a></p>
<p>Pixi by Petra is a brand offered at Target. I&#8217;ve tried a few items from them in my Ipsy bag and in my <a href="http://www.allureaccess.com/summer/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Allure Beauty Box</a>. They&#8217;ve rebranded and gone from simply Pixi to Pixi by Petra. Petra is the creator of Pixi. She is from Sweden and loves all things to do with folklore and fairies. The brand originally opened a flagship store in Soho, London. Since then, it&#8217;s expanded and you can now purchase the bright products at Target and other retailers. This eyeshadow sample is a smaller version of their full size Mesmerizing Mineral Palette.  This palette is $12 for a full size and comes in five different color sets. The shadow is mineral formula that&#8217;s made with vitamin E which is supposed to be good for your skin near the eyes. The sets are:</p>
<p>Rich Gold &#8211; gold, khaki, and moss green shades</p>
<p>Silver Sky &#8211; cream, silver, and smokey blue shades</p>
<p>Emerald Gold &#8211; emerald, copper, and cream shades</p>
<p>Plum Quartz &#8211; plum, cocoa, and pinky-nude shades</p>
<p>Copper Peach &#8211; peach, bronze, and russet shades</p>
<p>I really loved the <a href="http://www.pixibeauty.com/eyes/eyeshadow/mesmerizing-mineral-palette?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">eye shadows</a>. I used them for a summer look and applied the lighter gold on my lid and the darker shade above it. The color stayed on almost all day. Of course, it wasn&#8217;t up to par with my Urban Decay shadows but lasted a long time. Not too bad for only $12 for six shades.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.acureorganics.com/Day-Cream-gotu-kola-stem-cell-1-chlorella-grow-p/005.htm?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">  ACURE Day Cream, Sample Size 1 oz valued at about $10</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m always down for trying a new lotion or moisturizer. I&#8217;m even more down if that lotion or moisturizer is organic! ACURE Day Cream transported me to sunny Florida where I tend to eat more oranges than physically advised in a given day. The citrus smell was strong but not too overpowering. I&#8217;ll admit, I didn&#8217;t read up on the product before slathering on my hands and feet. Only later, <del>when I was writing this review</del>, did I realize that the product is supposed to be for your face. Either way, the formula helped my skin feel extra soft and I received compliments on the smell. According to ACURE, Day Cream has Gotu Kola Stem Cells which  helps to firm you skin and fight environmental damage and free radicals. I can&#8217;t really review the use on my face, but my hands sure felt great!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.skyniceland.com/product-32-hydro-cool-firming-eye-gels?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">skyn ICELAND Hydro Cool Firming Eye Gels, 2 Packs Valued at $7.50</a></p>
<p>These firming eye gels were really neat to try. This is one of the reasons I love <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/r/1dr1?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Ipsy</a>; I wouldn&#8217;t purchase these on my own. I don&#8217;t have trouble with under eye bags or dark circles, but tried these out one night in the bath. As soon as I placed them under my eyes, they felt nice and cool. I left them on for about ten minutes and when I took them off my skin felt firmer and my eyes looked bright. It kind of reminded me of someone adding air under my eyes so that they&#8217;d poof up! Although the results were nice, I passed the other set to my grandma, who I feel will get better use out of them. For those with under eye bags, these rock. I think if I ever have kids and need to look wide awake, these will come in handy. I&#8217;m much more open to trying other products from <a href="http://www.skyniceland.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">skyn ICELAND</a> now.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.booboocoverup.com/b/8629720011?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank"> Boo-Boo Cover-Up in Medium Shade, Baby Size $10</a></p>
<p>When I saw ahead of time that I was receiving a concealer, I was nervous. My skin is hard to match and if the color isn&#8217;t right, this product is a waste. I received the Boo-Boo Coverup in the color Medium. I tried it right away and it seemed to match OK. I would much rather like the Light shade but this may work for the Summer months when I have more color from the sun. What I really like about Boo-Boo Cover-Up is that it is made to help heal blemishes while it conceals. It has ale, chamomile, green tea, tea tree oil, and vitamin E. It also came in a great size which regularly retails at $10!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/p-229-butter-lipstick.aspx?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Butter Lipstick in Pops from NYX Cosmetics, Full Size $6 </a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">NYX Cosmetics</a> is my jam. Ever since I began following Charis Lincoln, or<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/charismastar?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank"> Charisma Star</a>, on Youtube, I fell in love with their products. I was excited to see I would get one of their lipsticks in my bag. Unfortunately, the color wasn&#8217;t one I would wear a lot. I still gave it a try. The color Pops is a nudey pink. It is a few shades darker than my skin tone and matches my lips pretty well. NYX&#8217;s Butter Lipsticks are supposed to be very moisturizing and they are. I liked how it went on smooth. I didn&#8217;t like that the color seemed to come off regularly and I had to reapply it. <strong>This formula reminded me more of a colored lip balm than a lipstick.</strong> Nonetheless, I really liked it and would try other shades.</p>

<h2> Overall: This Month&#8217;s Bag Was Pretty Good</h2>
<p>I was sad that the concealer didn&#8217;t really match my skin tone but I really liked the lipstick. The eye gels were something I wouldn&#8217;t buy myself so that was a nice thing to try. The Pixi shadows worked really well and I used up the ACURE Day Cream. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll re-buy anything except the Butter Lipstick from NYX. I still felt that for $10, it was a good deal. The entire bag was worth about $37.50. That&#8217;s over three times as much as I paid. For $10,<a href="https://www.ipsy.com/r/1dr1?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank"> I&#8217;ve been happy with Ipsy every time</a>. I just began subscribing to <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/5d724?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Birch Box</a>, so we&#8217;ll see if I can say the same for that. Also, the bag this month is adorable!</p>
<p>*I purchase Ipsy and Birch Box on my own. However, I have included my affiliate link so if you use it I&#8217;ll get a few points to use toward bonus items.</p>

<p>There’s just something about getting a little gift in the mail every month. When I was a little girl, I would run out to the mail to check if I had received letters or packages. One of my fondest mail memories was opening a package sent from Santa Claus that had a bunch of stationary and coloring pages. Years later, I’m still fascinated by snail mail and the new movement of “happy mail.” A way I indulge this little desire to receive a doorstep package every month is by subscribing to different subscription services.</p>
<p>Ipsy is an online beauty community created by Youtube star and makeup artist <a href="http://michellephan.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Michelle Phan</a>. In addition to offering videos and creative beauty content, the site’s main attraction is the <a href="http://www.ipsy.com/r/1dr1?sid=ipsypoints&amp;cid=general&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">monthly Glam Bag</a>. For $10, you can receive a curated makeup bag filled with goodies that are put together especially for you! Now, I know $10 can be a stretch for something a little extra, but I’ve noticed I purchase much less makeup and beauty products since receiving this monthly goodie (ask my husband)! Also, the products are great quality and add up to much more than $10.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong>Here’s what I received for the month of February!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0100.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0100-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0100" width="449" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0100-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 678w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0100-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0100-768x1160.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0100-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0100-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://eva-nyc.com/products/up-all-night-volumizing-spray-8-oz?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Up All Night Volumizing Spray by Eva NYC</a>, about $6 for sample size </strong></p>
<p>I tried the Up All Night Volumizing Spray on damp hair and allowed it to air-dry. The product is designed for blow-outs but I noticed it gave me more volume even though I didn&#8217;t hit my hair with my blow dryer! The smell is deliciously fresh. I really appreciate the fact you can use it to protect your hair from heating tools.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/luxie-beauty-brush.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-52 size-large" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/luxie-beauty-brush-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="luxie-beauty-brush" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/luxie-beauty-brush-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/luxie-beauty-brush-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/luxie-beauty-brush-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/luxie-beauty-brush-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.luxiebeauty.com/luxie-rose-gold-large-angled-face-brush-504/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Large Angled Face Brush 504 by Luxie Beauty</a>, $16 </strong></p>
<p>This face brush by Luxie Beauty has the same quality as (gasp) my Sephora brushes! The bristles are extra soft and create the perfect blush application. I really like the wide handle and have used it for both bronzer and the blush which was included in the bag. I’m glad the product is cruelty-free and would purchase more brushes from Luxie Beauty. I think this is the very first blush/face brush I’ve received in the two years I’ve been a subscriber. I really like that they included a blush and brush to go together for this look.</p>

<p>As much as I love the color pink, I don&#8217;t do light pink lipglosses. I tried this sample and liked the color payoff but not the color. It went on smooth and stayed on, but wasn&#8217;t for me. I&#8217;d love to try another shade!</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.modelcocosmetics.com/shop/jet-set-glamour-colour-essentials?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">BLUSH Cheek Powder by ModelCo in shade Peach Bellini</a>, $22</strong></p>
<p>When I saw this blush, I thought it looked too pigmented to create a more natural look. I was wrong! I used the included Luxie brush and lightly tapped it on my cheeks. After blending it out, I had created a natural looking pink flush! I have <a href="http://www.sephora.com/blush-P2855?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">NARS Organism </a>and love it but it has a lot of shimmer. This is a more peachy color and doesn’t have much shimmer. For my sister’s wedding makeup, I added some and then used<a href="http://www.sephora.com/bronzing-powder-P12790?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank"> NARS Laguna bronzer </a>underneath. It looked beautiful! Note to self: don’t write a product off just because the packaging or by first impression!</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://w.mawebcenters.com/qualitypencils/ecommerce/retail-catalog/amethyst-eye-pencil-img-src-http-site-mawebcenters-com-pencilmeincosmetics-thumbnails-amethyst-thumbnail-gif.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Natural Eye Liner Pencil by “Pencil Me In” Cosmetics in shade Amethyst</a>, $6.99</strong></p>
<p>I’m glancing down at my hand and can still see a trace from the eyeliner that I used when doing my sister’s makeup yesterday. The liner that was included in February’s Ipsy bag has been my jam! I’m not a huge fan of purple liners and usually wear my go-to <a href="http://www.sephora.com/tattoo-liner-P245205?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Kat Von D Tattoo black liner</a> but this stuff is great. The product glides on smooth and stays put. The color is a deep purple that looks really great with cool shadow colors. I had never heard of Pencil Me In Cosmetics and wasn’t sure about them until I tried the liner. On further inspection, I learned the brand has been featured in some notable magazines like <em>Women’s Day</em> and <em>Seventeen</em> and it’s made without harmful petroleum and parabens (win-win)! Pencil Me In Cosmetics offers thirty different colors in their liners and they’re about $7 each. This is one of main reasons why I adore Ipsy &#8211; I love trying new products and learning about new brands! I would’ve never even thought to try this kind of liner and am surprised at the quality and color payoff.</p>
<h2>Overall: I loved this months bag!</h2>
<p>The total products were totaled at about $57 and it included a cute pink cosmetics bag. For $10, I was really impressed and will use the majority of the items. My favorite was the liner and Luxie brush!
