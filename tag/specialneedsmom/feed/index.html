<p>We began overnight continuous feeds recently and it&#8217;s been such a game changer! Isabella has trouble gaining weight and was once slapped with the terrible diagnosis of &#8220;failure to thrive.&#8221; There are many reasons why she can&#8217;t eat by mouth, but for this post I&#8217;ll focus in on what an overnight continuous feed looks like for us. </p>

<p>I absolutely love the cute Honest Company diapers with the apples. We haven&#8217;t been able to share the wonder and beauty of Fall with Bella outside, but have decorated and used fun Fall things around the house&#8230;like these diapers.</p>



<h2>Getting Bella Ready For Bed </h2>



<p>Before bed, we put Bella in her pajamas and hook her up to her extension set. (I read it was best to attach the tubing to her diaper. I&#8217;ve gone away from that because we change her diaper throughout the night.) What you see here is her Mini One Feeding Tube attached to her extension set. We then give meds and her feed through the extension. The extension is good for an entire week. The feeding bag, which is filled with formula and attaches to the pump, is only good for 24hrs. (Yes, we throw away a pump bag and tubing every single day. It&#8217;s a crazy amount of waste). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-2395" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1174w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1174px) 100vw, 1174px" />
<figcaption>Trying overnight feeds the first time</figcaption>
</figure>



<h2>The First Night</h2>



<p>For the first night I had Bella sleep right next to me. I was very nervous about her strangling herself, pulling her button out, or vomiting and choking/aspirating. Here you can see Bella is hooked up to the pump tubing, IV pole, and extension set. It went amazingly. She didn&#8217;t even vomit! I woke up a lot of check on her but she seemed so happy and content. When I woke up I realized I had gotten SO MUCH SLEEP and so had she. It was crazy. I&#8217;m used to only getting 5 hours, interrupted. To switch to 8 hours was a massive blessing.</p>



<h2>Why Do Overnight Feeds Help Isabella?</h2>



<p>Overnight continuous feeds work well because Isabella has GERD (severe acid reflux) and a premature GI system. She is unable to take large volumes of formula at a time via feeding tube without throwing it up or being in pain. The goal of a continuous feed is to ensure she gets the nutrition she needs. The hope is that the very tiny amount of volume she gets per minute will be tolerated well and she will be less likely to vomit with less in her stomach. It also helps that she can rest uninterrupted. </p>



<p>Of course this is an added bonus to us! We have been on a &#8220;newborn&#8221; schedule until now (7 months) and her feeds were taking us a minimum of an hour and a half. We would need to hold her upright for an hour during the feed and then another 30 minutes to help prevent vomiting. Even then she would throw up quite a lot. To be completely honest we would bring ice packs to bed with us while feeding her to stay awake. We would blare our TV and talk to each other or watch movies. We couldn&#8217;t fall asleep during her feeds and it was very exhausting. At the time when her vomiting was at its worst we were feeding her 8x a day. To do the feed, hold her, prep the pump, etc, it was 2 hours each time. We literally spent 16 hours a day feeding Bella. </p>

</figure>



<h2>Setting Bella&#8217;s Pump, How Does It Work?</h2>



<p>The pump can be set for different rates and amounts of volume for her to receive. For Bella, we give her 30ml of a specific formula custom for her every hour. That&#8217;s 1/2 an ounce an hour. Or, 1/2ml per minute. It&#8217;s basically like an IV drip, only with formula. We allow this to run from 10pm until 9am. The formula is good to be hung for 4 hours. We wake up 2x to refill the pump bag with fresh formula mixed up and prepped in the fridge. </p>

</figure>



<h2>Why Do You Wake Up?</h2>



<p>We wake up at 2am and 6am. At this time we rewarm a bottle and add the liquid to the pump bag. We also check on Bella&#8217;s tubing, change her diaper, and check for leaking. At 2am I also give her a medication that I push through her tubing with a syringe. At 9am (or later if she&#8217;s still sleeping and we can squeeze a bit extra formula in) her alarm on her pump will sound and I will turn it off. The alarm sounds if the bag is empty, but we set our own alarms. We certainly don&#8217;t want to forget to refill the bag or else the pump will pump air into her belly! That can be very painful for a little one. Above you can see that her Gtube sometimes leaks. We have to change her outfit and sheets when this happens. </p>

<h2>Does She Still Eat During The Day?</h2>



<p>Yes! Bella still gets fed 3x during the day. We give her 75ml over an hour at 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm. She gets a little over 1ml an hour. She tolerates it rather well and usually just naps during the 12pm and 4pm feed on my chest. I still have to hold her upright for an hour and a half. Then, at the 8pm feed she falls asleep and stays asleep for the rest of the night. Of course we accidentally wake her to take her to bed and &#8220;hook her up&#8221; but she usually just groggily smiles and then falls back asleep.</p>

<figcaption>Mommy and Me Time!</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>I love feeding Bella. It&#8217;s a very special time. She snuggles up and I have an hour and a half to just be cozy with her. In the beginning I had to do this A LOT (8x a day shared with Dustin). That made it hard to do anything, including making insurance calls and eat. Now it&#8217;s only 2x a day and Dustin does 1. This 3 hours is helpful to slow down and rest. Above is my setup for Bella&#8217;s feeds. I&#8217;m tethered to her and her pump so I make sure to empty my bladder, get anything I want nearby and get comfy! I just finished a fun book called Girl Wash Your Face. </p>

<h2>Overnight Feeding Has It&#8217;s Challenges</h2>



<p>So, sleeping almost all night and not waking up every few hours is amazing. It&#8217;s so crazy awesome. BUT, there are some challenges with overnight feeds.</p>



<p>Bella moves around a lot and can pull on her button.</p>



<p>We alter her sleepers if they don&#8217;t have snaps by cutting a hole in them for the tubing. I run these down her leg to help keep her from tugging on the tubing or getting it caught around her neck. It&#8217;s actually pretty hard to find a ton of snap sleepers that are warm! So, we use zipper ones and just alter them ourselves. </p>



<p>We just recently began running the tubing through an empty paper towel roll to help keep it from away her head.</p>



<p>Sometimes if the button is pulled she leaks all over herself and the bed. We have to change out her clothing and the bedding. </p>



<p>The friction on her button causes her to break out. She can get skin breakdown near her stoma (stomach hole). So we have to keep bandages on it and rash cream to keep it from bleeding. </p>



<p>Sometimes I worry about her silently aspirating the formula into her lungs. If she does it silently after vomiting, I have no way of knowing or stopping the pump if I&#8217;m asleep. I&#8217;ve had to simply give this fear to God and trust that Bella is big enough to turn her head and spit formula out. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-2434" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" />

</figure>



<h2>Overall, It&#8217;s the Right Choice For Bella </h2>



<p>Continuous overnight feeds has certainly helped Bella so much. She still vomits at least once during the night or morning, but it&#8217;s not a lot of formula! Sometimes she&#8217;ll go all night not vomiting and will simply wake up throwing up a small volume! I don&#8217;t even have to change her bedding. For us, this is awesome. She was throwing up 5+ times a night before and not gaining the weight she desperately needed. Now, she seems to be hitting new milestones and seems to rested. We&#8217;ve put off continuous feeds during the day, to keep her from being hooked up all the time, and hope we can keep avoiding it by doing this. We can also avoid certain medications to empty her stomach quicker and a GJ tube which puts formula into her small intestine! </p>

<p>Also, note, our bed is made! Thanks to the extra sleep I was getting. I can&#8217;t remember when I took the above pictures, but you better believe the bed is made now almost every day thanks to the restful night and clean bedding with no throw up! </p>

<p>One of the greatest gifts we&#8217;ve received are professional photographs taken in the NICU. These were taken while Bella was only 14 days old. I remember signing up so excitedly on the paper sign up sheet in the family lounge and then crying when I realized she would have her cpap (breathing help/mask thing) on. I walked back up and began crossing our names off the list. But Dustin looked at me and said &#8220;Tiffany, we want these pictures. We have nothing to be embarrassed about. This is her right now. This is her journey.&#8221; It&#8217;s true! I&#8217;m so glad we didn&#8217;t wait until she looked &#8220;ideal&#8221; to take these photos. This was us. This was her. This was our reality.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2204" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179-1024x819.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="819" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179-1024x819.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179-300x240.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179-768x614.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179-640x512.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>But of course I struggled when I looked down at her and the photographer walked into the room. I even asked the nurses if we could sneak the cpap off for a few photos. (So silly of me). I was still very much overwhelmed and in a lot of pain from my emergency c-section. I was also pumping like crazy, living in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, taking pain killers, taking blood pressure medication, and trying to be a mom. It was one of the hardest times of my life yet it was filled with so much peace and joy. I believe that this is reflected in these photos.</p>

<p>To be honest, I almost didn&#8217;t want anyone to see these. Bella looks&#8230;scary. Kind of like an animal. She doesn&#8217;t really look like the cuddly baby you imagine or see in pictures. BUT we loved her all the same and I held onto hope that she would grow and develop into a beautiful little one&#8230;and God didn&#8217;t put that hope to shame!</p>

<p>Looking back, I carefully curated things I shared with the world. Dustin and I always wanted the way we presented our story to be a story of hope and love. We wanted Bella to be able to look back and be proud of how we shared her journey. I believe we have been good stewards of this. Some questioned early on&#8230;including us&#8230;if we should share so transparently about our journey. I know it&#8217;s not for everyone&#8230;and not everyone is called to it&#8230;but we felt we were called by the Lord to share Isabella with everyone in a public way.</p>

<p>From the day years ago that God told me I&#8217;d have a daughter and to name her Isabella Melody we&#8217;ve known she would be used greatly in His Kingdom.</p>

<p>So, I share these photographs to inspire others and give them a HOPE. You probably are looking up viability of a 27 weeker or maybe you are in the NICU and hope your baby will look a bit different as the month go on. (They will).</p>

<p>Isabella was born at 27 weeks but only weighed 1 lb 7 ounces due to restricted growth. I had an emergency cesarean that I was put under for since I had severe preeclampsia and stage 2 HELLP Syndrome that threatened my life.</p>

<p>If you notice the shock and awe of this image&#8230;it&#8217;s because this was the very first time I held Bella cradled in my arms and without doing skin to skin! For 14 days I had only held her chest to chest and while doing kangaroo care (skin to skin).</p>

<p>As the days passed her coloring got better, she grew, and medical devices and medications were slowly taken away. Now, she is 6 months old and doing great. She has a feeding tube due to silent aspiration but other than that she is a healthy, happy baby.</p>

<p>If you look closely you can see the strange white hair that covered her entire little body. This is called lanugo and went away after awhile. She was very fragile at this time to we used help getting her out of the isolette and she wasn&#8217;t moved around too much.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have to post more about this information, but she doesn&#8217;t have clothing on because she was in a controlled warm isolette and she needed to be seen by nurses/doctors. As she grew she could wear clothing&#8230;around 1 month or so.</p>
<p>I want to thank Simon Says Smile for this amazing gift to us. This is a volunteer program offered through <a href="http://www.blackdogphotoco.com/index.html/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Black Dog Photo Co.</a> They came and did this photo shoot free of charge. (AND later helped us when we accidentally overrode these pictures). AMAZING people.</p>
<p>Lastly, we had another amazing photo shoot done by Teresa Young. She also gifted these amazing photos to us. This was a very emotional moment as I had dreamed of some &#8220;normal&#8221; looking images of my tribe. Here&#8217;s a little teaser and I&#8217;ll post the rest another time.</p>

<p>Curious about her birthmark on her scalp? It&#8217;s called a hemangioma. It&#8217;s a superficial birth mark. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/whats-on-her-head-a-hemangioma-story/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Learn more from this post.</a></p>

<p>This little princess is wise beyond her years. 6 months, about 9 1/2lbs in this image. Adjusted age is 3 months.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 10:01pm here. I&#8217;m in the basement. I&#8217;m in our office writing on my computer.</p>
<p>As a busy new mom to a baby girl I should probably be showering or sleeping or brushing my teeth or working out&#8230;but I&#8217;m writing.</p>
<p>I get an itch. An itch to write my thoughts and feelings and get them out of my head.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s therapeutic and one of the things I credit for me sanity these days.</p>
<p>Times Are Rough</p>
<p>&#8230;oh, but they&#8217;re so rewarding and full of joy.</p>
<p>My Body Is Tired</p>
<p>&#8230;but I&#8217;ve never felt so alive.</p>
<p>My Head Hurts</p>
<p>&#8230;but I continue to strive to show kindness, empathy, compassion, and encouragement to my family.</p>
<p>I Feel Weak</p>
<p>&#8230;but I&#8217;ve never felt so strong (and dare I say brave?)</p>

<p>Right now I&#8217;m listening to the &#8220;Teen Party&#8221; mix on Spotify. I&#8217;m drinking out of a bright yellow cup. I threw on my floral matching pajamas. I wholeheartedly believe that what I surround myself makes a difference in my attitude and outlook on life. Bring on the bright colors. Bring on the fun teen beats.</p>

<h2>Isabella&#8217;s Reflux</h2>
<p>Isabella had a pretty good day. She&#8217;s adjusting to her new formula which is Alimentum and medication for her severe reflux. We had an appointment yesterday and she has gained an ounce a day since our last emergency appointment! This is very encouraging. We were referred to a GI specialist. That will be our next step in treating her stomach issues <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/its-not-a-bad-day-its-a-day-with-bad-things-in-it/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">(Click here to learn more about why she&#8217;s having issues).</a> She is still coughing, choking, and gagging, but she is doing it less. She still spits but not at every feed. We feel the prayers and God has been leading us to solutions. Praise Him! <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8873-e1532226139377.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2119 aligncenter" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8873-e1532226139377-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="374" height="499" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8873-e1532226139377-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8873-e1532226139377-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8873-e1532226139377-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" /></a></p>
<h2>Isabella&#8217;s Hemangioma</h2>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8886-e1532226230826.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class=" wp-image-2128 aligncenter" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8886-e1532226230826-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="475" height="633" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8886-e1532226230826-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8886-e1532226230826-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8886-e1532226230826-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></a>It&#8217;s looking worse, but we are going to Akron Children&#8217;s on Monday. Her pediatric dermatologist was amazing and called us today and ordered the new medication so that we could begin treatment on Monday. We will pick it up and bring it to his office with us. This is very nice because we were only going to go over her liver ultrasound results and talk about her care plan. We typically would have to come back to have him give her the first dose and monitor her.</p>
<p>Since we live an hour and twenty minutes away and have a bunch of other appointments, he offered to begin it on Monday. She will be given propranolol at his office and will stay there for an hour and a half to two hours to be monitored. After that we will come back a week later to adjust the dosage. From there we only need to see him once a month to adjust the dose based on her weight. I&#8217;m relieved she doesn&#8217;t need to be admitted. I&#8217;m also relieved we won&#8217;t need to travel to Akron every week! This medication will work to shrink blood vessels and will assist in shrinking her hemangioma, which is a vascular birthmark on her head. We hadn&#8217;t originally wanted to treat it, since it was only cosmetic, but as time went on it became a health concern. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/whats-on-her-head-a-hemangioma-story/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Click here</a> to learn more about it and why we&#8217;re treating it!</p>
<h2>So Many Other Things, So Little Time</h2>
<p>There are so many other things to write about and update. Bella is fed every 3 hours and Dustin and I take shifts. Her feed is hung by gravity currently and drips like an IV into her tummy. It takes about 50 minutes for 65ml to go in. We hold her during her feed. Then we have to continue holding her in an upright position. This takes a lot of time! It&#8217;s also a great time to bond with our cute lil one. We love cuddling. She typically falls asleep during her feeds. With her on my chest I browse Pinterest, Facebook, read blogs, and research things regarding her health. I see it&#8217;s almost time for her to eat again so I must run up to assist Dustin in her care.</p>
<p>Goodnight!</p>
