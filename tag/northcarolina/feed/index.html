There is a big waterslide and two different tiers to the pool. (My little sister stayed here on her honeymoon!) The entire space is held in a large open-window building and it&#8217;s very warm in there. It&#8217;s one of my favorite pools to go when in the Smokies.</p>

<p>When no one was looking we took turns going down on the waterslide our stomachs and laughing a lot. It was a pretty fast slide. Afterwards, we ran back to the room, got ready, and were on our way.</p>

<p>Instead of heading straight to our bed and breakfast in Waynesville, North Carolina, we drove down the hill and hit the main strip in <a href="http://www.gatlinburg.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Gatlinburg</a>. There are all different types of shops and quirky attractions.</p>
<h5>Dustin described it as a weird fair that happens all year long.</h5>
<p>Gatlinburg is one of those places that you either love or hate. I&#8217;ve been coming here since I was an itty bitty girl so I have fond memories here. We vacationed a lot in the area around with both sets of my grandparents. I love the odd shops like the Beef Jerky outlet and Ripley&#8217;s Believe It Or Not Museum. It also doesn&#8217;t hurt that the scenery is beautiful.</p>

<h1>The Donut Friar, Gatlinburg, Tennessee</h1>
<p>It was raining. That put a damper on our day. Most of the shopping is outside. So we ate at Subway and then walked around to the different shops. I insisted we stop at <a href="http://www.thevillageshops.com/donutfriar.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Donut Friar</a>. This shop has THE BEST donuts in the world. Dustin later said he wasn&#8217;t impressed.</p>
<h5>I almost murdered him.</h5>
<p>He got to eat much more than I did. I only had a little bite because of my new diet.</p>
<p>Each donut is made fresh in the morning and the little shop is located in <a href="http://www.thevillageshops.com/donutfriar.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Village</a>. There is also a lovely coffee shop right down the way but the line was too long and we had to get going.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1228" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6468" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>Dino approves.</p>
<p>Other places we visited included random shops,<a href="http://www.bootleggerswine.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"> bootleggers homemade wine shop</a>,  and <a href="http://olesmoky.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">the moonshine distillery</a>. Both offer free samples, which is really neat. We don&#8217;t drink a lot, but don&#8217;t mind having a try while on vacation. Our favorite was the Strawberry Wine and Java Moonshine! I also bought a bright pink sweatshirt for $10 that says &#8220;Gatlinburg.&#8221; Dustin thought it looked kinda silly because it was so bright but I loved it!</p>
<h1>Clingman&#8217;s Dome, Great Smokey Mountains National Park</h1>
<p>With the donut as our energy (JK, we actually ate a healthy lunch), we drove up to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/clingmansdome.htm?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Clingman&#8217;s Dome</a>. This is part of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park and is located at the top of a mountain. You drive up the mountain and then go on a narrow road. At the top there is a small visitor&#8217;s center, port-a-pots, and a 1/2 mile hike to the top. On this day, it was very rainy and foggy. In fact, when we got to the place to park we couldn&#8217;t even see out. I remembered coming here as a girl and it was really awesome. Unfortunately we didn&#8217;t get a peek at the sights the entire time.</p>
<p>Even though it was sleeting we decided to hike to the top. It was only 1/2 mile so it couldn&#8217;t be hard, right? Oh my! It was a challenge. It was straight up the entire time. My legs were very tired and I had to stop a few times. It was frustrating because I&#8217;ve been working out and trying to get in shape. But, we made it to the top and it didn&#8217;t take too long, just a few short breaks.</p>

<p>The dome itself is pretty neat. Once you&#8217;re at the top you&#8217;re supposed to be able to see over 100 miles on a good day. For us, we could only see a few feet. It was foggy and cold. We still enjoyed the physical challenge though&#8230;and met some Christians who were climbing to the top to praise Jesus. That was really cool. We got back in the car and went on our way to Waynesville, North Carolina which took us about an hour and a half from Gatlinburg.</p>
<h1>The Yellow House Bed and Breakfast, Waynesville, North Carolina</h1>
<p>We arrived at <a href="http://www.theyellowhouse.com/index.htm?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Yellow House</a> at about 4:00pm. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/two-nights-at-the-yellow-house-on-plott-creek-road/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Last year we found this adorable bed and breakfast on Groupon</a>. We saw they were having another deal so we bought another. The stay was $200 for two nights. It was a steal!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1229" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6470" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>Shawn, the host, showed us to our room which was located inside the main house. Last year when we stayed we stayed in a separate suite by the upper pond. (<a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/two-nights-at-the-yellow-house-on-plott-creek-road/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">CLICK HERE</a> to see our trip last year.) The room we had picked this time was the Montecito. The room was lovely. The bed was super cozy and I loved the decor.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1255" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6544" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>I liked that the room had charm but felt modern and super neat. The room was located on the second floor. Like last year, Shawn showed us around and made sure we knew where the snacks in the butler&#8217;s pantry were. Dustin made sure to get lots of fresh cookies. I wasn&#8217;t feeling too great and neither was Dustin when we arrived. We had some snacks at the wine and cheese reception but then headed back to our room. Surprisingly, we stayed in the room the entire night. I had thought we&#8217;d go to <a href="http://sweetonionrestaurant.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Sweet Onion</a>, a restaurant I loved from last time, but it was closed since it was a Sunday.</p>

<p>I took a bath and put on one of their cozy robes. We ate some food we brought in the room and also had some snacks that were free. The mini fridge was stocked with drinks, which was a nice touch. I loved the included bath salts which smell so heavenly. Some of the games we played were Chinese Checkers and 3/13.</p>

<p>In the evening we turned on the fireplace. I loved sitting in the big overstuffed floral chair and reading. So did Dustin. Our room also had a coffee maker so we made some tea for me and coffee for him. It was very relaxing and cozy.</p>
<h5>I think we were both shocked when we went to bed at 10:30pm! (There are no TV&#8217;s in the rooms. There is wifi, but you&#8217;re encouraged to just connect with others).</h5>
<p>Another cool aspect of the room was that there was music playing through a sound system that&#8217;s wired throughout the house. You can turn it off or up/down. I liked the jazz and classical sounds. It made the experience feel extra special. We had our own private bath and toilet which was nice as well.</p>

<p>Our room was rounded and there were windows all around the bed. You can see in this image where the room was:</p>

<p>Our bed was between the three windows in the back which are poking out. It was adorable. The next morning we awoke for breakfast on the patio and a full day in Asheville!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>

<p>It was Saturday, June 4th, and we&#8217;d already done so much! After <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/big-green-dinosaur-sunsphere-goats-on-the-roof/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">feeding goats on the roof </a>(literally), we decided it was time for us to eat!</p>
<h1>The Old Mill Restaurant &amp; Shops, Pigeon Forge, Tennessee</h1>
<p>One of our all-time favorite places to eat is The Old Mill Restaurant in Pigeon Forge. The portions are massive and the food is so delicious. There are also a lot of shops and things to do before eating. We went into the shops at the Old Mill Square. <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/info/farmhouse-kitchen?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Farmhouse Kitchen</a> was adorable and there were lots of samples to try. We purchased some sparkling cider and some chip dip for Dustin&#8217;s parents who were graciously watching our kitties while we were away.</p>
<p>I was super excited to go into <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/info/sassafras?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Sassafras</a>. The shop was in a little corner and had some adorable jewelry. In the back, everything was an extra 50% off. I picked up both a necklace and a bracelet for under $10. There were lots of opportunities to try different olive oils and we snacked and snacked, tasting different combinations.</p>

<p>One of the neater stores we walked into was the <a href="http://www.randalloglegallery.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Randall Ogle Gallery.</a> Inside there were some beautiful paintings. The man there was Randall himself. We were able to talk to him and he told us more about Cades Cove and how to see a bear. His paintings were really peaceful. On the brochure I picked up it said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Smokey Mountain Heritage,&#8221; the focal point of native artist Randall Ogle&#8217;s work, depicts unique scenes of the Great Smokey Mountains. The largest collection of Cades Cove artwork in the area featuring the special edition series &#8220;Cades Cove, Yesteryear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once we had enough shopping, we grabbed a seat at <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Old Mill</a>. I hadn&#8217;t had cheese in a long time but ordered a small side of macaroni and cheese. Even though it was delicious, I regretted it later! The mashed potatoes, corn fritters, and green beans were to die for! It is truly a magnificent place. It was also the only time I allowed myself sweet tea on the trip. This was a hard decision for me, but I know it was a good one. Sweet tea has too much sugar in it!</p>

<p>Our room at The Park Vista was really nice. As a <a href="http://hhonors3.hilton.com/en/index.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Hilton Honors member</a> we got free bottles water and a mountain view upgrade. They also had us draw a prize out of a bowl. We won a coupon for a free appetizer at the hotel&#8217;s bar or restaurant.</p>

<p>The hotel itself is a large cylinder. When I was a little girl my parents brought me here. I remember dropping a Toy Story toy down the 15th floor that we got in a kids meal. It was of an army figure with a parachute on its back. We would race to see whose hit the ground first. It looked like this:</p>

<p>Now, the hotel is owned by Hilton and has been remodeled. It&#8217;s up on a mountain and offers great views. The pool is also pretty fabulous. They have a nice waterslide that we went on a lot the next morning.</p>
<h1>Cades Cove, Great Smokey Mountains National Park</h1>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1214" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6421" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-30x23.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1632w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the hotel was so full (at 5pm) that we weren&#8217;t able to check-in to our room. This was super sad since it was a pretty pricey hotel room for one night. We shrugged and decided to head to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/cadescove.htm?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Cades Cove</a> since it was raining. Cades Cove is outside of Gatlinburg and is part of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. It&#8217;s a looonnnnggg drive. It took us over an hour to get back to the park.</p>
<p>Was it worth it? Yes. Because BEARS.</p>

<p>I prayed and prayed we would see a bear. I&#8217;d heard of others driving back and not seeing one and just seeing deer. I concluded that even if we didn&#8217;t see a bear it was a beautiful place (which it is)!</p>
<h4>It&#8217;s one of those untouched places in the world that makes you feel alive and free. The beauty was overwhelming.</h4>
<p>Lucky for us there had been rain. So, we got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">double rainbow.</a>  (A Full On Double Rainbow!) This was actually after we had already seen a bear. A young, adolescent bear, as Dustin would call him, pass in front of our car!</p>

<p>What a beautiful sight! The Lord stays true to his promises!</p>
<p>We drove the 11 mile loop and ended up seeing not one, but two bears. The first was smaller, but went right in front of our car. We got out and got to see him very up close!</p>

<p>We drove and saw ponies, turkey, and lots of dear. The wild turkey were pretty funny to watch as the moved their heads around in the grass. Later, we got to see a very large bear. This one I&#8217;d say was closer to 300+ pounds. He was further away, but we were on a hill and he was eating so we got to watch him well for over ten minutes. We actually left before he did!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s difficult to make him out, but I think you get the idea. There were others with massive lenses and professional cameras. We just used our phones and tried to live in the moment. Other things we did at Cades Cove included visiting some old cabins and an old church. We walked into the church out of the rain and explored. It was too dark to take pictures. The cabin was very cozy. It would&#8217;ve been a lovely sight to wake up to the mountains every morning. Below are pictures we took right in front of one of the original cabins.</p>

<p>On our way out of the park, we had to drive very carefully because wildlife could jump out in front of your car. This is an example:</p>

<p>I love how the deer is reflected in the water on the road which was left over after it had rained. The smoke on the mountains was so beautiful. This is probably one of the best pictures I&#8217;ve taken with my iPhone! I made sure you could see our dash so you could tell we were indeed driving!</p>
<p>If seeing 2 bears, a double rainbow, and other wildlife wasn&#8217;t enough, we ended up getting to see a momma bear and 2 cubs! On our way out of the park, I turned up some worship music and settled in for the long drive back. We came across lots of cars parked. There, in the forest, was a momma bear and two cubs. The lady beside me said they were the smallest cubs she&#8217;d ever seen and that they were probably very young. We couldn&#8217;t get a good picture, but it was a very special ending to our night. Praise the Lord and His beauty!</p>

<p>After Cades Cove we drove back to The Park Vista and checked in. We enjoyed the room and also went down to their bar for our free appetizer. There was a lovely outside patio, rocking chairs, and fire pit. The space was called <a href="http://www.parkvista.com/gatlinburg-restaurant-lounge.php?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Fireflies</a>. The hummus plate was really good and we sat around the fire.</p>

<p>Later, we decided not to swim but to enjoy the room and watch Cops. One of our favorite travel tv shows.</p>
<p>It had been a long day, but I was so happy we saw BEARS!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>

<p>While staying at The Yellow House, we took all day Saturday, May 30th to explore Asheville, North Carolina. Unfortunately I had a lot of writing to do, so after we finished breakfast on the porch of the inn, we drove to a coffee shop in downtown Asheville.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wakinglifeespresso.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Waking Life Espresso</a> was exactly what we needed to get our work done while in the mountains. This little coffee shop is located in a remodeled house and is light filled and airy. In the front there are bar seats and in a smaller room in the back there are couches and a table. The coffee was no-frills and especially delicious. To see how serious they are about their coffee, watch this <a href="https://vimeo.com/103960232?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">video</a>.</p>
<p>I worked on my articles and Dustin just hung out. (Perhaps working? I&#8217;m not sure.) At about 2:00pm, we drove the ten minutes to <a href="http://www.biltmore.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Biltmore</a>, the main attraction for the day.</p>

<p>When I was a little girl, I remember visiting The Biltmore. This mansion is known as the largest privately owned house in the United States. It&#8217;s interesting because Dustin had also been there with his parents when he was eighteen. We remembered bits and parts (like the indoor swimming pool) but wanted to go together. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/two-nights-at-the-yellow-house-on-plott-creek-road/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Yellow House</a> was about thirty minutes from Asheville, where The Biltmore is located.</p>

<p>The price tag was enough to shy us away, but we decided since we were close we should go. My love for interiors and art history really helped to sway the decision to drop the $120 ($60 per ticket) and spend the day there. I also used my vacation money to buy the tickets.</p>

<p>Words and pictures really don&#8217;t do this place justice. It took hours to tour and there was a room dedicated to arranging flowers. The Vanderbilt&#8217;s, who owned the home, were fascinating people who loved art and each other. An example of architecture from The Gilded Age, the mansion has <strong>252 rooms</strong>.</p>

<p>Pictures and videos are prohibited of the inside. George Vanderbilt shared a love for technology and entertaining guests. It was really interesting to see the parallels between the couple, George and Edith, and us. He loved technology and had electricity throughout the home and Edith loved books and taking care of guests.

It reminded me of the library in <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>! This couple was madly in love and took the best care of those they employed. Even the servants quarters were nice!</p>

<p>Dustin and I found ourselves staring on multiple occasions at the craziness of it all. The massive dining room had <strong>three fireplaces</strong> and there were separate rooms dedicated to guns, smoking, and games. I personally loved seeing the restored furniture and paintings by famous artists.</p>

<p>You can easily spend more than a day at The Biltmore. Along with the mansion, there is shopping, dining, a winery, hiking trails, gardens, and entertainment. There are hotels on site and even tours for taking horseback rides. We didn&#8217;t have enough time to see everything, but after going through the mansion we enjoyed the gardens for a bit. We drove over to Antler Hill Village where there were shops and a winery. While there, there was also live music in the center gazebo.</p>
<p>We brought our own snacks and got an appetizer at <a href="http://www.biltmore.com/visit/things-to-do/dining/cedrics-tavern?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Cedric&#8217;s Tavern</a> located at the <a href="http://www.biltmore.com/visit/village-winery?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Antler Hill Village</a>. We had hoped to eat dinner at Cedric&#8217;s, but after seeing the menu, nothing seemed that good. The place was over-priced. Since we were hungry and still had more to see, we ordered an appetizer. It was way too salty and not very good. After wasting $20 on an appetizer and water, we asked for our bill.</p>
<p>The winery wasn&#8217;t anything too special. We tried a few wines but didn&#8217;t like waiting in line. (Wine tasting is free with your ticket.) After buying a book about the mansion, we left to eat somewhere outside of the park.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a really neat experience. A $60 ticket only included admission to the mansion and property. The audio tour was an additional amount and there were other behind-the-scenes tours we didn&#8217;t take. I felt that the $60 ticket was fine for us. We saw plenty and I purchased a book to learn even more.</p>

<p>Dustin and I said we loved it, but wouldn&#8217;t go back anytime soon. <strong>It was one of those places that you go once and don&#8217;t need to keep going back.</strong> I would like to see it decorated for Christmas though. The property was very romantic.</p>

<p>In the future, we&#8217;d go back if we had kids. It&#8217;s one of those places that&#8217;s so out of this world, but very expensive. If you plan on going, eat ahead of time or bring snacks. We left and ate at an amazing place called The White Duck Taco.</p>

<p>While walking about, we acted like we owned the place. We laughed and told stories about our day to day lives as millionaires. It was fun to dream.</p>

<p>You could go and spend a day just going through the gardens. It felt like I was transported into the book <em>The Secret Garden</em>. It was hot and we were hungry so we only walked a short ways and drove the rest. I don&#8217;t usually suggest buying more than a one day ticket, but for The Biltmore, it would be worth it.</p>
<p>This stop on May, 30th was one of our favorite places on our Southern Road Trip. To see an overview of all we did on this vacation, <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/a-southern-road-trip/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">click here</a>!</p>

<p>When we went off on our own, we headed to <a href="http://www.theyellowhouse.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Yellow House On Plott Creek Road</a>. This little bed and breakfast is located in the charming town of Waynesville, North Carolina. I had heard of it through Groupon. For $299, you received a two-night stay in a suite, checking in on Friday. As usual, I read reviews before purchasing the deal and saw plenty of high ratings. The pictures looked fantastic. We left Starbucks and drove straight to the bed and breakfast in the rain. I hadn&#8217;t realized we were running a little late for check-in, so I called ahead and let the inn-keeper know. Shawn was extremely accommodating welcomed us at the door.</p>

<h3>Friday, May 29th: First Night at The Yellow House &amp; Dinner at The Sweet Onion</h3>
<p>As soon as we drove up, the air seemed to get lighter. There was a magical feeling about this place. It felt as if we had gone back in time. The yellow house overlooked a lot of greenery and you could see it from the road. The mountains in the background looked like someone had painted them. We heard a bunch of folks talking on the front porch and saw some plates and glasses of wine.</p>

<p>When we walked in, a man introduced himself as Shawn. He began whisking us around the old home, pointing out port wine, a pantry full of snacks, a cheese plate, and board games. <strong>It felt like we were coming back home to place we&#8217;d never been. </strong>There were about ten different people eating appetizers and visiting in the parlor and front porch. Shawn explained that it was their cheese and wine reception.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-623" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhousestaircase" width="678" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 678w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-768x1160.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></a></p>
<p>The floor creaked below our feet and the china in the cabinets softly clinked as we walked into the butler pantry. Shawn told us to help ourselves to snack bars, cereal, fresh fruit, and cookies (he baked fresh every day). He showed us the hot water for tea and where we could leave our plates. There was also a room with books and lots of board games. Before taking us to our suite, which was located in another building, Shawn explained that the inn had plenty of material on the town and all the menus from local restaurants.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-621" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhouseparlor" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>I noticed the inn was clean and well appointed. It was cozy and worn but not stuffy. A large clock stood to the right and there was a buffet with port wine and small glasses. On the coffee table there were lots of different photo books dedicated to the bed and breakfast. My favorite was a day in the life of the inn&#8217;s cat. Shawn had made the book, telling the story of the inn from the resident cat&#8217;s perspective. Another book was filled with pictures of the inn during different seasons.</p>

<p>We followed Shawn up a small road to another building that housed our suite.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-600" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhouseviewofsuite" width="678" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 678w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-768x1160.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></a></p>
<p>We booked the Kinsale Suite. It&#8217;s located in a small house overlooking the upper pond. Along with a front area with rocking chairs, the suite had a small porch in the back. I loved hearing the creek as we got out of our car and Shawn climbed out of his golf cart .</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-601" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhousewithcar" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Once inside, I was surprised at how clean and cozy the space felt. Shawn showed us around, offering instructions on the double-sided fireplace and showing us how to close the built-in blinds. He also explained that the fridge was stocked with complimentary drinks and told us how the air-jetted tub worked. He told us he&#8217;d leave some cheese and crackers out a little bit longer and told us to hurry back to the house and eat. I sat some bags down and headed over.</p>
<p>The wine and cheese reception was great. Shawn had two different types of wine, china laid out, hummus, crackers, different cheeses, and snacks. We both grabbed some plates and a glass of wine. Sitting on the front porch, we took a deep breath and looked over the property. You could hear the birds chirping and glasses clinking. Some people were sitting inside, others at the outside sitting area. Afterwards, we looked around at the menus collected in a basket near the reception area. Shawn told us that there would be a wait since we didn&#8217;t have reservations. I laughed. We were in the middle of nowhere, how could there be a wait for dinner? After deciding on a place called The Sweet Onion, we went back to the suite to freshen up.</p>

<p>The Kinsale was ideal. The bed was extra comfy and I loved the unique art and furniture.</p>

<p>We adjusted the individual thermostat and turned up the air conditioning. I looked around, inspecting the room. I loved the double-sided fireplace that could be enjoyed from the bed and bathtub.</p>

<p>The space was large, with two separate rooms and a bathroom with a walk-in shower. The tub was sparkling and had Yellow House branded bath salts beside it and soaps. I also noticed handmade mugs with the bed and breakfast&#8217;s logo on them by the coffee maker.</p>

<p>There was an ice box, microwave, coffee maker, and fridge. Inside the fridge were bottled juices, sodas, and Perrier Sparkling Bottled Water. Coffee and tea was placed in a basket near a roll of paper towels. There were also extra cozy robes with the bed and breakfast&#8217;s logo on them hanging up. They smelled like fresh linen and were really soft to the touch.</p>

<p>Another unique touch was a dark hand towel with the words &#8220;Make Up&#8221; embroidered onto it. The rest of the towels were white, so this was a good place to take off my red lipstick.</p>

<p>After freshening up, we drove to <a href="http://www.sweetonionrestaurant.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Sweet Onion</a>. Sure enough, Shawn had been right. There was a thirty minute wait for the Southern farm fresh restaurant. Downtown Waynesville, The Sweet Onion made me think of a New Age hippie that grew up in the South. There were waiters with cool tattoos serving up fresh fritters and fried chicken. Water was poured into mason jars and the place felt like a modern southern diner&#8230;only more pricey.</p>

<p>The food was phenomenal. I ordered chicken fingers with macaroni and cheese. Dustin had a chicken parmesan sandwich. We talked and talked and laughed. It was a wonderful meal. When we left, we decided to walk around the little town.</p>

<p>Waynesville is quaint. It reminds me of the town in the book/movie <em>The Notebook</em>. There are cute little shops with mountains as the backdrop. Even though it&#8217;s a country area, there are nice art shops and galleries. Everything was closed but the May air was hot. We walked and walked. There were a few bars and pizza joints open. I was surprised to see an old theater. <a href="http://www.38main.com/index.php/about-us?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Strand</a> is a boutique theater that offers free viewings of movies. It was late and we wanted to enjoy our room. If we weren&#8217;t tired we would have watched a movie and ordered some homemade sodas. There were lots of people walking dogs and we even looked in the window of a dog bakery. Sleepy, we headed back to the Yellow House amidst the mountains.</p>

<p>We walked to the Yellow House (a four minute walk) from our suite. Shawn had showed us the code to get in. Lights were low and people were talking upstairs. We sat in the parlor and drank small glasses of port wine. We talked about our dinner and moving to the mountains. After grabbing a board game, we headed back to our room. There were matches and small aromatic candles near the bath. I took a relaxing bath and we went to sleep early.</p>

<p>The next morning, we walked to the front porch for breakfast. Shawn asked us if we wanted to eat inside or outside. Of course we said outside. The weather and view was perfect! A few welcoming women waited on us and offered us juice and coffee. Shawn was walking around in an apron, visiting casually with other guests. I could smell the food.</p>

<p>The first morning we had the following: fruit cups with yogurt, bacon, peach french toast, and more fruit for dessert with powdered sugar. The peach french toast was delicious. Shawn handed out recipe cards. The next morning we had fruit, asparagus, tator tots, and ham spinach quiche.</p>

<p>The portion sizes were abundant. We were seated with another couple. After visiting, we realized we had a lot in common. This was their second time there using a Groupon and they had driven from Atlanta, Georgia. They were both Christians and we found that out from where the wife had gone to college (another conservative-Christian school). It was really nice to get to visit with other Christians. What a blessing! I wish I would&#8217;ve gotten their information. The husband was from Ecuador and had a strong accent. The wife had also lived in Chicago near Lincoln Square. We knew a lot of the same areas and subway stops. (We also had matching blue nail polish!)</p>

<p>That day, Saturday, May 30th,  we explored Asheville, North Carolina. Among the things we did was work at a coffee shop, visit the Biltmore, and eat at a local taco place. We left The Yellow House on Sunday, May 31st.</p>

<p>A few times we saw a black and white kitty lazying around the property. We walked around and enjoyed the outdoors. It was kept beautifully. There were lots of butterflies and other birds.</p>

<p>Dustin managed to find a hammock. He laid back and took a deep breath in. We were relaxed and wanted to stay a few more nights. While checking out, Shawn told us more about the area and also told us the brand of the port wine we sipped (Taylor Tawny Port). Before heading out, we played cards on the front porch.</p>

<p>It was such a lovely experience. The Groupon deal is gone but I&#8217;ve heard they have them occasionally. Even if you don&#8217;t have a Groupon it&#8217;s well worth it for the stay. You can read lots of reviews on <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g49648-d80701-Reviews-The_Yellow_House_on_Plott_Creek_Road-Waynesville_North_Carolina.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Tripadvisior</a>. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49648-d80701-r276564007-The_Yellow_House_on_Plott_Creek_Road-Waynesville_North_Carolina.html#REVIEWS?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">link</a> to my contribution. This bed and breakfast way by far one of the nicest we&#8217;ve visited. If you stay, tell Shawn we said hello!</p>
