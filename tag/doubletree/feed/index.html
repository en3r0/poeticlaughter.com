				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we woke up at <a href="http://www.parkvista.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Park Vista</a> in Gatlinburg on Sunday, June 5th,  we decided to head down to the awesome pool! There is a big waterslide and two different tiers to the pool. (My little sister stayed here on her honeymoon!) The entire space is held in a large open-window building and it&#8217;s very warm in there. It&#8217;s one of my favorite pools to go when in the Smokies.</p>

<p>When no one was looking we took turns going down on the waterslide our stomachs and laughing a lot. It was a pretty fast slide. Afterwards, we ran back to the room, got ready, and were on our way.</p>

<p>Instead of heading straight to our bed and breakfast in Waynesville, North Carolina, we drove down the hill and hit the main strip in <a href="http://www.gatlinburg.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Gatlinburg</a>. There are all different types of shops and quirky attractions.</p>
<h5>Dustin described it as a weird fair that happens all year long.</h5>
<p>Gatlinburg is one of those places that you either love or hate. I&#8217;ve been coming here since I was an itty bitty girl so I have fond memories here. We vacationed a lot in the area around with both sets of my grandparents. I love the odd shops like the Beef Jerky outlet and Ripley&#8217;s Believe It Or Not Museum. It also doesn&#8217;t hurt that the scenery is beautiful.</p>

<h1>The Donut Friar, Gatlinburg, Tennessee</h1>
<p>It was raining. That put a damper on our day. Most of the shopping is outside. So we ate at Subway and then walked around to the different shops. I insisted we stop at <a href="http://www.thevillageshops.com/donutfriar.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Donut Friar</a>. This shop has THE BEST donuts in the world. Dustin later said he wasn&#8217;t impressed.</p>
<h5>I almost murdered him.</h5>
<p>He got to eat much more than I did. I only had a little bite because of my new diet.</p>
<p>Each donut is made fresh in the morning and the little shop is located in <a href="http://www.thevillageshops.com/donutfriar.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Village</a>. There is also a lovely coffee shop right down the way but the line was too long and we had to get going.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1228" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6468" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>Dino approves.</p>
<p>Other places we visited included random shops,<a href="http://www.bootleggerswine.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"> bootleggers homemade wine shop</a>,  and <a href="http://olesmoky.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">the moonshine distillery</a>. Both offer free samples, which is really neat. We don&#8217;t drink a lot, but don&#8217;t mind having a try while on vacation. Our favorite was the Strawberry Wine and Java Moonshine! I also bought a bright pink sweatshirt for $10 that says &#8220;Gatlinburg.&#8221; Dustin thought it looked kinda silly because it was so bright but I loved it!</p>
<h1>Clingman&#8217;s Dome, Great Smokey Mountains National Park</h1>
<p>With the donut as our energy (JK, we actually ate a healthy lunch), we drove up to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/clingmansdome.htm?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Clingman&#8217;s Dome</a>. This is part of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park and is located at the top of a mountain. You drive up the mountain and then go on a narrow road. At the top there is a small visitor&#8217;s center, port-a-pots, and a 1/2 mile hike to the top. On this day, it was very rainy and foggy. In fact, when we got to the place to park we couldn&#8217;t even see out. I remembered coming here as a girl and it was really awesome. Unfortunately we didn&#8217;t get a peek at the sights the entire time.</p>
<p>Even though it was sleeting we decided to hike to the top. It was only 1/2 mile so it couldn&#8217;t be hard, right? Oh my! It was a challenge. It was straight up the entire time. My legs were very tired and I had to stop a few times. It was frustrating because I&#8217;ve been working out and trying to get in shape. But, we made it to the top and it didn&#8217;t take too long, just a few short breaks.</p>

<p>The dome itself is pretty neat. Once you&#8217;re at the top you&#8217;re supposed to be able to see over 100 miles on a good day. For us, we could only see a few feet. It was foggy and cold. We still enjoyed the physical challenge though&#8230;and met some Christians who were climbing to the top to praise Jesus. That was really cool. We got back in the car and went on our way to Waynesville, North Carolina which took us about an hour and a half from Gatlinburg.</p>
<h1>The Yellow House Bed and Breakfast, Waynesville, North Carolina</h1>
<p>We arrived at <a href="http://www.theyellowhouse.com/index.htm?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Yellow House</a> at about 4:00pm. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/two-nights-at-the-yellow-house-on-plott-creek-road/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Last year we found this adorable bed and breakfast on Groupon</a>. We saw they were having another deal so we bought another. The stay was $200 for two nights. It was a steal!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1229" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6470" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>Shawn, the host, showed us to our room which was located inside the main house. Last year when we stayed we stayed in a separate suite by the upper pond. (<a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/two-nights-at-the-yellow-house-on-plott-creek-road/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">CLICK HERE</a> to see our trip last year.) The room we had picked this time was the Montecito. The room was lovely. The bed was super cozy and I loved the decor.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1255" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6544" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>I liked that the room had charm but felt modern and super neat. The room was located on the second floor. Like last year, Shawn showed us around and made sure we knew where the snacks in the butler&#8217;s pantry were. Dustin made sure to get lots of fresh cookies. I wasn&#8217;t feeling too great and neither was Dustin when we arrived. We had some snacks at the wine and cheese reception but then headed back to our room. Surprisingly, we stayed in the room the entire night. I had thought we&#8217;d go to <a href="http://sweetonionrestaurant.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Sweet Onion</a>, a restaurant I loved from last time, but it was closed since it was a Sunday.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6475.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1232" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6475-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6475" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6475-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6475-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6475-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6475-30x23.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>I took a bath and put on one of their cozy robes. We ate some food we brought in the room and also had some snacks that were free. The mini fridge was stocked with drinks, which was a nice touch. I loved the included bath salts which smell so heavenly. Some of the games we played were Chinese Checkers and 3/13.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6472-e1468805847253.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1231" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6472-e1468805847253-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6472" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6472-e1468805847253-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6472-e1468805847253-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6472-e1468805847253-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6472-e1468805847253-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6472-e1468805847253.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>In the evening we turned on the fireplace. I loved sitting in the big overstuffed floral chair and reading. So did Dustin. Our room also had a coffee maker so we made some tea for me and coffee for him. It was very relaxing and cozy.</p>
<h5>I think we were both shocked when we went to bed at 10:30pm! (There are no TV&#8217;s in the rooms. There is wifi, but you&#8217;re encouraged to just connect with others).</h5>
<p>Another cool aspect of the room was that there was music playing through a sound system that&#8217;s wired throughout the house. You can turn it off or up/down. I liked the jazz and classical sounds. It made the experience feel extra special. We had our own private bath and toilet which was nice as well.</p>

<p>Our room was rounded and there were windows all around the bed. You can see in this image where the room was:</p>

<p>Our bed was between the three windows in the back which are poking out. It was adorable. The next morning we awoke for breakfast on the patio and a full day in Asheville!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>

<p>It was Saturday, June 4th, and we&#8217;d already done so much! After <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/big-green-dinosaur-sunsphere-goats-on-the-roof/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">feeding goats on the roof </a>(literally), we decided it was time for us to eat!</p>
<h1>The Old Mill Restaurant &amp; Shops, Pigeon Forge, Tennessee</h1>
<p>One of our all-time favorite places to eat is The Old Mill Restaurant in Pigeon Forge. The portions are massive and the food is so delicious. There are also a lot of shops and things to do before eating. We went into the shops at the Old Mill Square. <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/info/farmhouse-kitchen?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Farmhouse Kitchen</a> was adorable and there were lots of samples to try. We purchased some sparkling cider and some chip dip for Dustin&#8217;s parents who were graciously watching our kitties while we were away.</p>
<p>I was super excited to go into <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/info/sassafras?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Sassafras</a>. The shop was in a little corner and had some adorable jewelry. In the back, everything was an extra 50% off. I picked up both a necklace and a bracelet for under $10. There were lots of opportunities to try different olive oils and we snacked and snacked, tasting different combinations.</p>

<p>One of the neater stores we walked into was the <a href="http://www.randalloglegallery.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Randall Ogle Gallery.</a> Inside there were some beautiful paintings. The man there was Randall himself. We were able to talk to him and he told us more about Cades Cove and how to see a bear. His paintings were really peaceful. On the brochure I picked up it said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Smokey Mountain Heritage,&#8221; the focal point of native artist Randall Ogle&#8217;s work, depicts unique scenes of the Great Smokey Mountains. The largest collection of Cades Cove artwork in the area featuring the special edition series &#8220;Cades Cove, Yesteryear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once we had enough shopping, we grabbed a seat at <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Old Mill</a>. I hadn&#8217;t had cheese in a long time but ordered a small side of macaroni and cheese. Even though it was delicious, I regretted it later! The mashed potatoes, corn fritters, and green beans were to die for! It is truly a magnificent place. It was also the only time I allowed myself sweet tea on the trip. This was a hard decision for me, but I know it was a good one. Sweet tea has too much sugar in it!</p>
<h1>The Park Vista by Doubletree, Gatlinburg, Tennessee</h1>

<p>Our room at The Park Vista was really nice. As a <a href="http://hhonors3.hilton.com/en/index.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Hilton Honors member</a> we got free bottles water and a mountain view upgrade. They also had us draw a prize out of a bowl. We won a coupon for a free appetizer at the hotel&#8217;s bar or restaurant.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1225" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6463" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>The hotel itself is a large cylinder. When I was a little girl my parents brought me here. I remember dropping a Toy Story toy down the 15th floor that we got in a kids meal. It was of an army figure with a parachute on its back. We would race to see whose hit the ground first. It looked like this:</p>

<p>Now, the hotel is owned by Hilton and has been remodeled. It&#8217;s up on a mountain and offers great views. The pool is also pretty fabulous. They have a nice waterslide that we went on a lot the next morning.</p>
<h1>Cades Cove, Great Smokey Mountains National Park</h1>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1214" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6421" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-30x23.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the hotel was so full (at 5pm) that we weren&#8217;t able to check-in to our room. This was super sad since it was a pretty pricey hotel room for one night. We shrugged and decided to head to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/cadescove.htm?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Cades Cove</a> since it was raining. Cades Cove is outside of Gatlinburg and is part of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. It&#8217;s a looonnnnggg drive. It took us over an hour to get back to the park.</p>
<p>Was it worth it? Yes. Because BEARS.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1218" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447-1024x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6447" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447-1024x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447-150x150.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 150w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447-300x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447-768x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447-30x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447-200x200.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 200w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>I prayed and prayed we would see a bear. I&#8217;d heard of others driving back and not seeing one and just seeing deer. I concluded that even if we didn&#8217;t see a bear it was a beautiful place (which it is)!</p>
<h4>It&#8217;s one of those untouched places in the world that makes you feel alive and free. The beauty was overwhelming.</h4>
<p>Lucky for us there had been rain. So, we got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">double rainbow.</a>  (A Full On Double Rainbow!) This was actually after we had already seen a bear. A young, adolescent bear, as Dustin would call him, pass in front of our car!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1213" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6419" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-30x23.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>What a beautiful sight! The Lord stays true to his promises!</p>
<p>We drove the 11 mile loop and ended up seeing not one, but two bears. The first was smaller, but went right in front of our car. We got out and got to see him very up close!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1212" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6407" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>We drove and saw ponies, turkey, and lots of dear. The wild turkey were pretty funny to watch as the moved their heads around in the grass. Later, we got to see a very large bear. This one I&#8217;d say was closer to 300+ pounds. He was further away, but we were on a hill and he was eating so we got to watch him well for over ten minutes. We actually left before he did!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s difficult to make him out, but I think you get the idea. There were others with massive lenses and professional cameras. We just used our phones and tried to live in the moment. Other things we did at Cades Cove included visiting some old cabins and an old church. We walked into the church out of the rain and explored. It was too dark to take pictures. The cabin was very cozy. It would&#8217;ve been a lovely sight to wake up to the mountains every morning. Below are pictures we took right in front of one of the original cabins.</p>

<p>On our way out of the park, we had to drive very carefully because wildlife could jump out in front of your car. This is an example:</p>

<p>I love how the deer is reflected in the water on the road which was left over after it had rained. The smoke on the mountains was so beautiful. This is probably one of the best pictures I&#8217;ve taken with my iPhone! I made sure you could see our dash so you could tell we were indeed driving!</p>
<p>If seeing 2 bears, a double rainbow, and other wildlife wasn&#8217;t enough, we ended up getting to see a momma bear and 2 cubs! On our way out of the park, I turned up some worship music and settled in for the long drive back. We came across lots of cars parked. There, in the forest, was a momma bear and two cubs. The lady beside me said they were the smallest cubs she&#8217;d ever seen and that they were probably very young. We couldn&#8217;t get a good picture, but it was a very special ending to our night. Praise the Lord and His beauty!</p>

<p>After Cades Cove we drove back to The Park Vista and checked in. We enjoyed the room and also went down to their bar for our free appetizer. There was a lovely outside patio, rocking chairs, and fire pit. The space was called <a href="http://www.parkvista.com/gatlinburg-restaurant-lounge.php?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Fireflies</a>. The hummus plate was really good and we sat around the fire.</p>

<p>Later, we decided not to swim but to enjoy the room and watch Cops. One of our favorite travel tv shows.</p>
<p>It had been a long day, but I was so happy we saw BEARS!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
