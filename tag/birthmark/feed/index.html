<p>We&#8217;ve been on our<a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/whats-on-her-head-a-hemangioma-story/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"> Hemangioma journey</a> for quite some time now. I&#8217;ve learned a lot about vascular birthmarks. I&#8217;ve also learned a lot about medications.</p>
<p>We made the decision to treat Isabella&#8217;s Hemangioma (the large red tumor on her scalp) because it was ulcerating and causing harm to her.</p>
<p>That being said, you can<a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/whats-on-her-head-a-hemangioma-story/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"> read more about that decision and meeting with a top Pediatric Dermatologist here.Â </a></p>
<p>Isabella has been taking propranolol for almost 3 months now. This is a blood pressure medication that helps to treat Hemangiomas, which are full of blood vessels. We are very happy with the progress and anticipate the birthmark fading more and disappearing by the age of two.</p>

<p>Here is the side-by-side. The top is when it was at its worst and the bottom is how it looks today after treatment. We gave/give her <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/propranolol-oral-tablet?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">propranolol</a> and also used a topical antibiotic to prevent infection.</p>

<p>What it looks like now.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m so thankful I made the right decision and listened to my mother&#8217;s instinct.</strong> We were told by a nurse practitioner that the darkening spots were nothing to worry about and that she had seen hundreds of birthmarks like it before. I wanted to make sure, so I sent images of the spots to our Pediatric Dermatologist. He immediately got back to us and put her on an antibiotic andÂ  had us come in for an urgent appointment to begin treatment. He explained that it was, indeed, ulcerating and that it was very dangerous.</p>
<p>If your child has a Hemangioma, please seek out medical advice. It&#8217;s best to reach out to a Pediatric Dermatologist who has experience with vascular birthmarks. In many cases these will not need treatment and will fade on their own. (I personally know two friends with preemies who have them). In other cases, like Bellas, there could be skin breakdown and cosmetic implications (like a bald spot). If a baby has 5 or more, it&#8217;s common practice to do an ultrasound to rule out internal ones as well. Isabella went through this and doesn&#8217;t have any internally.</p>
<p>Lastly, thanks for your prayers and here is how God&#8217;s answered them since my <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/whats-on-her-head-a-hemangioma-story/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">first post on Bella&#8217;s birthmark.</a></p>
<p>Prayer requests and how God&#8217;s answered:</p>
<p><strong>1.) This birthmark doesnât ulcerate any further and that with treatment we can avoid pain and discomfort.Â </strong></p>
<p>The birthmark didn&#8217;t ulcerate any further. It began to dry up and actually scabbed over. Bella hasn&#8217;t felt any pain in 2 months.</p>
<p><strong>2.) Bella tolerates the medication.</strong></p>
<p>Bella has tolerated the medication fine! Her hands and feet are sometimes cold because of the blood pressure medication, but no other symptoms are noted. Sometimes she&#8217;ll vomit a dose, but she vomits all the time, so we don&#8217;t see any correlation.</p>
<p><strong>3.) That we would be able to handle the magnitude of treating such a little one with such a serious prescription. That we would be extra careful with doses and track it well.</strong></p>
<p>The medication was/is super scary to use, but it&#8217;s become habit. We double check the dosing and make sure it&#8217;s given with her feed. We use syringes and give it to her through her Gtube. At first we tracked it with an app. Now, we know exactly when she gets it and have it written on a schedule board in our kitchen with her medications. We also have the dose written on the board. I keep a screenshot of her medications/doses on my phone as well.</p>
<p><strong>4.) Also, pray against any internal hemangiomas. We have no reason to believe she has any, but it is a possibility.</strong></p>
<p>We did an ultrasound and there were NO internal hemangiomas! There was a strange spot on her liver which we have to go back for another scan in a month or so, but other than that, no issues. The radiologist thinks it was just a shadow and after a full blood work work up, our GI specialist agreed it&#8217;s nothing to worry too much about.</p>

<p>Isabella was born without any birthmarks, but, after a few weeks we noticed a small, flat, red spot on her head. The NICU team assumed it was agitation from her CPAP hat so we switched her breathing assistance to give it a break from rubbing. After looking closely, her primary nurse and I determined it didn&#8217;t look like skin breakdown but more of a permanent spot. She threw out the thought, &#8220;oh she&#8217;s probably got a hemangioma!&#8221; I, of course was terrified looking up images (after learning to say/spell it).</p>
<p>My worst assumption ended up coming to fruition, Bella has a large hemangioma that looks every bit as scary as some of the ones I saw with my search. Simply put, it&#8217;s harmless, is considered a vascular birthmark, should go away as she grows, and is a collection of blood vessels. We did an MRI to rule out any issues and it&#8217;s completely superficial and cosmetic. Long story short, we choose not to treat it a few months ago. We got a second option from a pediatric dermatologist and heard from many neonatologists who treated Bella. We felt that was the right decision and that we would embrace it until things needed addressed. Until&#8230;</p>
<figure id="attachment_2102" style="width: 332px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8825.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2102 " src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8825-e1532047107349-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="332" height="443" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8825-e1532047107349-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8825-e1532047107349-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8825-e1532047107349-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Repping Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital, where we lived for 100+ days!</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Why is her birthmark a problem?</h2>
<p>Sadly, after being readmitted to the NICU we noticed 3 more teeny red dots/beginning of hemangiomas on her tummy/chest. They are elevating but don&#8217;t look scary yet. We were advised to follow up with dermatology to reconsider treatment. When there are 5, it&#8217;s recommended to begin treatment because there&#8217;s higher risk of internal ones. Internal ones can cause issues with major organs. The large one on her head is also growing rapidly. So, we were waiting for August 9th for her appointment when we noticed the birthmark changing color. I knew these things could ulcerate (skin breakdown), but hadn&#8217;t seen signs before. I&#8217;m so glad I trusted my intuition. I immediately contacted our dermatologist who confirmed with images it is beginning to ulcerate. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f641.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="ð" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We began treating it with antibiotic cream and see him on Monday. (He offered the next day but we felt Bella needed to rest after going through so much). He said ulceration could be extremely painful. I&#8217;ve seen what they look like when they break down and it&#8217;s very painful looking.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s next? Isn&#8217;t it an easy fix?</h2>
<p>We will begin treatment with a drug called propranolol. This medication inhibits the growth of blood vessels and constricts current ones. This is hard for us as Bella is the size of a newborn (7lbs 12 ounces) and the thought of messing with her blood pressure/cardiovascular system terrifies us. That being said, with monitoring her blood pressure and vitals this treatment is safe and effective. It&#8217;s very commonly used. We don&#8217;t want the ulceration to get worse and we certainly don&#8217;t want to worry about internal hemangiomas!</p>

<p>I, personally would also like to prevent the others from getting to the size of her larger one. Since they&#8217;re on her chest/stomach they could interfere with her tummy time or gtube. After talking to the doctor, we decided to do a liver ultrasound just to confirm there aren&#8217;t any hemangiomas there. So, on Monday we&#8217;ll be trekking to Akron Children&#8217;s for her appointment and ultrasound.</p>

<p>Please pray</p>
<p>1.) This birthmark doesn&#8217;t ulcerate any further and that with treatment we can avoid pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>2.) Bella tolerates the medication.</p>
<p>3.) That we would be able to handle the magnitude of treating such a little one with such a serious prescription. That we would be extra careful with doses and track it well.</p>
<p>4.) Also, pray against any internal hemangiomas. We have no reason to believe she has any, but it is a possibility.</p>
<p>XOXO, Tiffany</p>
