</a></p>
<p>We just got back from Europe and the February <a href="https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/N3/ALL/beautybox_landing_save5.jsp?cds_page_id=195230&amp;cds_mag_code=ALL&amp;cds_response_key=S5ZA3AB6&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Allure Beauty Box</a> was waiting for me. I loved almost everything in it and still think it&#8217;s one of the best beauty boxes out there. Well, I was confused because a few days later this past Monday there was ANOTHER box at the door. I assumed it was March&#8217;s beauty box&#8230;until I did a quick search online. Other bloggers were saying that this box is a completely free bonus box! It&#8217;s called the <a href="http://www.mysubscriptionaddiction.com/2016/02/allure-beauty-box-red-carpet.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Allure Red Carpet Bonus Beauty Box</a>. I remembered entering a sweepstakes and didn&#8217;t realize I won. The box is valued at $88!</p>
<p>How Stinking Cool!</p>
<p>So, I began this blog post writing about what I thought was the March box to find out it was just a free, just-because box. Aren&#8217;t &#8216;just because&#8217; things the very best?</p>
<p>The box came with a mini magazine like usual and a lot of products. What caught my attention right away was Allure&#8217;s collaboration with Cover Girl. I&#8217;m not a big fan of Cover Girl, but the products included were full sized and were inspired by Katy Perry&#8217;s Grammy&#8217;s look.</p>
<p>As I was opening the box, I did find it strange that there wasn&#8217;t much variety, but I assumed that since the value of the full sized products was so high, it was a special box. I didn&#8217;t realize it was a freebie! There was no indicator on the box that it had been a bonus box.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what was included:</p>
<p>Covergirl Plumpify Blast Pro in Very Black, $8.99</p>
<p>Covergirl Tru Blend Primer for Combo Skin, $9.99</p>
<p>Covergirl Intensify Me! Liquid Eyeliner, $8.00</p>
<p>Covergirl Colorlicious Oh Sugar! Lip Balm in Candy, $8.99</p>
<p>SK-II Facial Treatment Essence, $33</p>
<p>SK-II Facial Treatment Mask, $17</p>
<p>Wella Oil Professionals Oil Reflections Smoothening Oil, $10</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sk-ii.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-SKII-Site/default/Home-Show?&amp;cm_mmc=PPC-IP-GGL-_-SKII_Search_Brand+Awareness.Exact-_-Brand_General_Exact-_-sk%20ii_mkwid_srEbg7smN_78590811431_sk%20ii_e_c&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQiAjMC2BRC34oGKqY27jtkBEiQAwSXzfnU90lj3gwvQsBRdmwLBF1y3P94869ep3VplY4WZaI8aAh5S8P8HAQ&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">SK-II</a> is a brand I&#8217;ve heard of but haven&#8217;t tried anything from. Some quick research on Sephora revealed that the brand is from Japan. Actresses like Cate Blanchett swear by their skin products. The box included two expensive items. (Oh, yea, that&#8217;s why I hadn&#8217;t tried it!) The first was the brand&#8217;s Facial Treatment Mask. The masks I usually buy at Sephora are about $8. This mask is a whopping $17! It&#8217;s supposed to be a part of wedding rituals. Sephora says,</p>
<p>&#8220;This 100 percent cotton mask drenches the skin with pitera’s fusion of vitamin, amino acids, minerals, and organic acids, while working to revitalize, comfort, and provide intense hydration. It immediately replenishes dehydrated skin, leaving it refreshed and cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other item included was <a href="http://www.sephora.com/search/search.jsp?keyword=essence&amp;ref=1360665&amp;defaultSortBy=-1&amp;pageSize=60&amp;browserdefault=true&amp;om_mmc=ppc-GG&amp;mkwid=szMT2P5wM&amp;pcrid=70118698972&amp;pdv=c&amp;site=us_search&amp;country_switch=us&amp;lang=en&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQiAjMC2BRC34oGKqY27jtkBEiQAwSXzfmoAqC7maY6mvsf2v7GO6BeBYQSy5Xp_jlaNfrBPPYYaAidR8P8HAQ&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">SK-II&#8217;s Facial Treatment Essence</a>. This product seems so ambiguous. What&#8217;s facial essence? Well, of course, I looked it up.</p>
<p>#1 it&#8217;s super expensive</p>
<p>#2 it looks just like good quality H2O</p>
<p>#3 it&#8217;s supposed to change your skin and be worth the price tag</p>
<p>Hmm. Sephora explains it like this</p>
<p>&#8220;Facial Treatment Essence is enriched with more than 90 percent Pitera—the main ingredient used to enhance the skin&#8217;s renewal process—plus nourishing vitamins, amino acids, minerals, and organic acids to promote a healthy skin cell renewal cycle. With daily application, this essence moisturizes, improves texture and clarity, and contributes to a more beautiful, balanced, and glowing complexion. &#8221;</p>
<p>We shall see. I haven&#8217;t tried either.</p>
<p>The other product that wasn&#8217;t Covergirl was the Wella Oil. I rolled my eyes when I saw this product. Another hair oil? You bet! I have enough to bathe in twice a day for a year. Ok, ok ok. This product does work. I did drop $40 with Birchbox points for Bumble and Bumble&#8217;s Hairdresser&#8217;s Oil, but this stuff seems to work just as well and it smells delicious. All you need is a small drop in the palm of your hands and it smooths out every frizz on your head. I think this will last me a very long time since you don&#8217;t need a lot. The size that was included was one ounce which is worth about $10.</p>

<p>The rest of the products included in this fabulous free box were from Covergirl. The mini magazine included a picture of Katy Perry from the Grammy&#8217;s. The products are supposed to be products she used for her look.</p>
<p>I really love the picture of her!</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;ve gotten the box, I&#8217;ve had a chance to try all the Covergirl products! Some I liked and others I&#8217;m not sure about.</p>
<p>The Intensify Me! eyeliner is interesting. It&#8217;s a liquid eyeliner, but it has a paddle-shaped applicator. I liked how pigmented it was but I found it difficult to apply. Now, it may just take some practice. I did notice the shape made cat eyes pretty easy to achieve. Again, this product is for a more dramatic look. You wouldn&#8217;t use it for a simple black liner look. It&#8217;s impossible to make it thin-lined. Since I messed up a bit, I went back over it with my holy grail tattoo liner from Kat Von D.</p>
<p>The mascara was much better than I expected! The massive brush reminds me of a DNA strand. It also comes separate from the base of the mascara. When you put the applicator in, you can really tell how black the formula is because the brush is orange-red. This mascara is really reasonable at $8.99. I think I could use this instead of my Marc Jacobs mascara!</p>
<p>I used the primer under my Kat Von D liquid foundation. I didn&#8217;t notice a big difference because I already mix my foundation with a primer. It says it&#8217;s for combo skin. This product I wouldn&#8217;t purchase since I&#8217;m sold on Kat&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Covergirl Colorlicious Oh Sugar! Lip Balm in Candy was really cool. I loved the smell and the packaging was pretty and sleek. The only drawback is it didn&#8217;t have any pigment. It said it was supposed to have some color, but it&#8217;s more of a clear balm. It seemed to me as if it was Covergirl&#8217;s version of Fresh&#8217;s Sugar products. Overall, it was a good clear balm that I&#8217;ll use over lipstick or on days I&#8217;m not wearing lip color.</p>
<p>Did you receive this box free? What do you think of Covergirl?</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>Now is the time to grab you debit card and buy both of the <a href="http://www.target.com/c/beauty-box-ways-to-shop/-/N-54wll?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Target Beauty Boxes</a>! They&#8217;re up live for back to college and are GREAT deals. I purchased both and an extra one for my sister-in-law who starts back at college in the Fall.</p>
<p>The Target Beauty Boxes are basically Target&#8217;s response to the beauty box fad. They highlight different beauty products and release boxes at different times of the year. I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s a schedule but I saw a link on a forum (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">BeautyBoxes</a>) I follow on Reddit. Here is what is included in each individual box:</p>
<h3>Back To College Honor Roll Box (pictured above)</h3>
<p>This box is my favorite of the two. It includes a lot of products I&#8217;ll use on a regular basis. It&#8217;s also the one I bought my sister-in-law. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s included:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/the-bathery-delicate-sponge-assorted/-/A-14775667#prodSlot=_1_8?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Bathery Delicate Pouf</a>, $1.99, full size</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/john-frieda-luxurious-volume-7-day-volume-in-shower-treatment-4-oz/-/A-16601228#prodSlot=_1_6?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">John Frieda Luxurious Volume 7-Day Treatment</a>, 1 ounce, sample size, $2.25</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/olay-fresh-cooling-white-strawberry-mint-outlast-body-wash-23-6oz/-/A-13509125?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Olay White Strawberry Body Wash,</a> 3 ounces, sample size, $0.99</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/nyx-butter-gloss/-/A-14723529#prodSlot=_1_11?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">NYX Butter Gloss Strawberry Parfait</a>, full size, $4.99 (it might be a tad bit smaller)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/goody-17ct-ouchless-4mm-black-elastic/-/A-11895555#prodSlot=_1_9?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Goodie Ouchless Elastics</a>, 3 bands, $0.99</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/cover-girl-1-floz-clear-makeup-setters-and-primers/-/A-17295396#prodSlot=_1_10?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">CoverGirl Outlast All-Day Primer</a>, full size, $9.79</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/burt-s-bees-facial-cleansing-towelettes-white-tea-extract-30-count/-/A-13729237#prodSlot=_1_4?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Burt&#8217;s Bees White Tea Facial Wipes</a>, 10 wipes, $2.99</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a total of $23.99 worth of products for only $5! I personally would spend $5 alone on an NYX butter gloss. I think that&#8217;s what caught my eye first. I like that there&#8217;s the perfect mix of makeup items and skincare/hair items. You can never have enough bath poufs, body wash, or elastics! This is an excellent deal and  comes with free shipping. You can order it <a href="http://www.target.com/p/target-beauty-box-back-to-college-honor-roll-box-20-value/-/A-21423545#?lnk=Grid_julybb_0713_X0Y0W4|X0Y0W4|T:Template_Grid1A|C:CMS&amp;intc=2676054|null&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">here</a>. Act quick though, these sell out quick!</p>

<h3>Back To College: Head of the Class Box (pictured above)</h3>
<p>Even though I won&#8217;t use a few of the items like the fashion tape and the pumice stone, I think this kit is still a steal. The mascara and Covergirl lip color are what sold me. Here&#8217;s what it includes:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/goody-17ct-ouchless-4mm-black-elastic/-/A-11895555#prodSlot=_1_9?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Goody Ouchless Effects</a>, 3 bands, $0.99</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/the-bathery-luxury-pumice/-/A-14266668#prodSlot=_1_13?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Bathery Pumice Stone</a>, full size, $1.99</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/hollywood-fashion-secrets-fashion-tape-36-ct/-/A-16587929#prodSlot=_1_7?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Hollywood Fashion Tape</a>, sample size, $4</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/covergirl-colorlicious-lip-gloss/-/A-15334470#prodSlot=_1_15?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Covergirl Colorlicious Lip Gloss</a>, full size, $5.99</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/wet-n-wild-mega-volume-plus-mascara-black/-/A-16601547#prodSlot=_1_12?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">wet n&#8217; wild Max Volume Plus Mascara</a>, full size, $4.99</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/herbal-essences-wild-naturals-illuminating-dry-oil-spray-2-8oz/-/A-16601144#prodSlot=_1_14?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Herbal Essences Wild Natural Illuminating Dry Oil Spray</a>, full size, $5.99</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/yes-to-cucumbers-face-towelettes-10-ct/-/A-13051305#prodSlot=_1_3?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Yes to Cucumbers Facial Wipes</a>, 10 count, $2.99</p>
<p>This box has a total of $26.94 worth of products! Even though the value is higher, I still liked the other better because I&#8217;ll use more of the products. I&#8217;m not sure what the hair oil will be like. I use a lot of other brands like <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/shop/beauty-protector-protect-and-oil?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Beauty Protector</a> and Bumble and Bumble so I may end up giving it away. I do, however, like the Covergirl lipgloss. I&#8217;m curious what color will come. Again, you can purchase this box <a href="http://www.target.com/p/target-beauty-box-back-to-college-head-of-the-class-20-value/-/A-21423546#?lnk=Grid_julybb_0713_X0Y0W4|X0Y0W4|T:Template_Grid1A|C:CMS&amp;intc=2676054|null&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">here</a> but order quickly! They may sell out by tonight! Each comes with FREE SHIPPING.</p>
<h3>Which box sounds the best to you? Are you going back to college? Would you like one of these in your mailbox?</h3>
