<p>It was Saturday, June 4th, and we&#8217;d already done so much! After <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/big-green-dinosaur-sunsphere-goats-on-the-roof/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">feeding goats on the roof </a>(literally), we decided it was time for us to eat!</p>
<h1>The Old Mill Restaurant &amp; Shops, Pigeon Forge, Tennessee</h1>
<p>One of our all-time favorite places to eat is The Old Mill Restaurant in Pigeon Forge. The portions are massive and the food is so delicious. There are also a lot of shops and things to do before eating. We went into the shops at the Old Mill Square. <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/info/farmhouse-kitchen?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Farmhouse Kitchen</a> was adorable and there were lots of samples to try. We purchased some sparkling cider and some chip dip for Dustin&#8217;s parents who were graciously watching our kitties while we were away.</p>
<p>I was super excited to go into <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/info/sassafras?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Sassafras</a>. The shop was in a little corner and had some adorable jewelry. In the back, everything was an extra 50% off. I picked up both a necklace and a bracelet for under $10. There were lots of opportunities to try different olive oils and we snacked and snacked, tasting different combinations.</p>

<p>One of the neater stores we walked into was the <a href="http://www.randalloglegallery.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Randall Ogle Gallery.</a> Inside there were some beautiful paintings. The man there was Randall himself. We were able to talk to him and he told us more about Cades Cove and how to see a bear. His paintings were really peaceful. On the brochure I picked up it said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Smokey Mountain Heritage,&#8221; the focal point of native artist Randall Ogle&#8217;s work, depicts unique scenes of the Great Smokey Mountains. The largest collection of Cades Cove artwork in the area featuring the special edition series &#8220;Cades Cove, Yesteryear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once we had enough shopping, we grabbed a seat at <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Old Mill</a>. I hadn&#8217;t had cheese in a long time but ordered a small side of macaroni and cheese. Even though it was delicious, I regretted it later! The mashed potatoes, corn fritters, and green beans were to die for! It is truly a magnificent place. It was also the only time I allowed myself sweet tea on the trip. This was a hard decision for me, but I know it was a good one. Sweet tea has too much sugar in it!</p>
<h1>The Park Vista by Doubletree, Gatlinburg, Tennessee</h1>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1223" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6453-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6453" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6453-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6453-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6453-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6453-30x23.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Our room at The Park Vista was really nice. As a <a href="http://hhonors3.hilton.com/en/index.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Hilton Honors member</a> we got free bottles water and a mountain view upgrade. They also had us draw a prize out of a bowl. We won a coupon for a free appetizer at the hotel&#8217;s bar or restaurant.</p>

<p>The hotel itself is a large cylinder. When I was a little girl my parents brought me here. I remember dropping a Toy Story toy down the 15th floor that we got in a kids meal. It was of an army figure with a parachute on its back. We would race to see whose hit the ground first. It looked like this:</p>

<p>Now, the hotel is owned by Hilton and has been remodeled. It&#8217;s up on a mountain and offers great views. The pool is also pretty fabulous. They have a nice waterslide that we went on a lot the next morning.</p>
<h1>Cades Cove, Great Smokey Mountains National Park</h1>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1214" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6421" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-30x23.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the hotel was so full (at 5pm) that we weren&#8217;t able to check-in to our room. This was super sad since it was a pretty pricey hotel room for one night. We shrugged and decided to head to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/cadescove.htm?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Cades Cove</a> since it was raining. Cades Cove is outside of Gatlinburg and is part of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. It&#8217;s a looonnnnggg drive. It took us over an hour to get back to the park.</p>
<p>Was it worth it? Yes. Because BEARS.</p>

<p>I prayed and prayed we would see a bear. I&#8217;d heard of others driving back and not seeing one and just seeing deer. I concluded that even if we didn&#8217;t see a bear it was a beautiful place (which it is)!</p>
<h4>It&#8217;s one of those untouched places in the world that makes you feel alive and free. The beauty was overwhelming.</h4>
<p>Lucky for us there had been rain. So, we got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">double rainbow.</a>  (A Full On Double Rainbow!) This was actually after we had already seen a bear. A young, adolescent bear, as Dustin would call him, pass in front of our car!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1213" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6419" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-30x23.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>What a beautiful sight! The Lord stays true to his promises!</p>
<p>We drove the 11 mile loop and ended up seeing not one, but two bears. The first was smaller, but went right in front of our car. We got out and got to see him very up close!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1212" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6407" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6407-e1468372209997.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>We drove and saw ponies, turkey, and lots of dear. The wild turkey were pretty funny to watch as the moved their heads around in the grass. Later, we got to see a very large bear. This one I&#8217;d say was closer to 300+ pounds. He was further away, but we were on a hill and he was eating so we got to watch him well for over ten minutes. We actually left before he did!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6424-e1468372305750.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1215" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6424-e1468372305750-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6424" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6424-e1468372305750-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6424-e1468372305750-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6424-e1468372305750-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6424-e1468372305750-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6424-e1468372305750.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to make him out, but I think you get the idea. There were others with massive lenses and professional cameras. We just used our phones and tried to live in the moment. Other things we did at Cades Cove included visiting some old cabins and an old church. We walked into the church out of the rain and explored. It was too dark to take pictures. The cabin was very cozy. It would&#8217;ve been a lovely sight to wake up to the mountains every morning. Below are pictures we took right in front of one of the original cabins.</p>

<p>On our way out of the park, we had to drive very carefully because wildlife could jump out in front of your car. This is an example:</p>

<p>How majestic!</p>

<p>I love how the deer is reflected in the water on the road which was left over after it had rained. The smoke on the mountains was so beautiful. This is probably one of the best pictures I&#8217;ve taken with my iPhone! I made sure you could see our dash so you could tell we were indeed driving!</p>
<p>If seeing 2 bears, a double rainbow, and other wildlife wasn&#8217;t enough, we ended up getting to see a momma bear and 2 cubs! On our way out of the park, I turned up some worship music and settled in for the long drive back. We came across lots of cars parked. There, in the forest, was a momma bear and two cubs. The lady beside me said they were the smallest cubs she&#8217;d ever seen and that they were probably very young. We couldn&#8217;t get a good picture, but it was a very special ending to our night. Praise the Lord and His beauty!</p>

<p>After Cades Cove we drove back to The Park Vista and checked in. We enjoyed the room and also went down to their bar for our free appetizer. There was a lovely outside patio, rocking chairs, and fire pit. The space was called <a href="http://www.parkvista.com/gatlinburg-restaurant-lounge.php?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Fireflies</a>. The hummus plate was really good and we sat around the fire.</p>

<p>Later, we decided not to swim but to enjoy the room and watch Cops. One of our favorite travel tv shows.</p>
<p>It had been a long day, but I was so happy we saw BEARS!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>We woke up at the Hampton Inn in Caryville, Tennessee and were shocked at the beauty that surrounded us! I knew ahead of time it was located in the Cove Lake State Park, but I didn&#8217;t realize you could see the mountains and a beautiful lake from the breakfast space! We began our second day of our road trip on Saturday, June 3rd. The hotel was pretty busy. Their breakfast was really well done. I loved the raisin bran and fresh fruit. Before, I would wonder what in the world a vegan would eat&#8230;but now it&#8217;s pretty simple. Fruit, whole grains&#8230;you get the picture.</p>

<p>My dad always took a picture of our cars when we went on vacation. I always thought it was weird but now I get it. You want to remember what you were driving and where! It&#8217;s harder to remember different parts of your life when you get older. Looking back you can be like &#8220;oh, I remember that clunker&#8221; or &#8220;oh, look at the two door thingy.&#8221; Well, this is our &#8220;new&#8221; 2014 Ford Focus that we bought last May. It was celebrating its first birthday on this trip. I didn&#8217;t post that we bought a new car on Facebook since it seemed a little braggy. Well, it&#8217;s a year now and I&#8217;m posting it here. I love the color. We got a great deal on it and it has AC! Our last car was the same as one as Dustin got for his birthday as a teen and it was on its last leg. We had the ability to donate it to a person which was awesome. So, yeah, here&#8217;s the car and it&#8217;s in Tennessee. I&#8217;ll probably look back at this and smile.</p>

<p>Selfies are hard!  We are twins with our black Zenni-Optical $20 glasses. (It really does work, I was skeptical too) I&#8217;m also wearing a tank top I got from Volunteers of America for $2 before the trip! One of the best things about losing weight is finding clothes that are on sale that fit! Woohoo.</p>

<p>Take 2. Still squinting into the sun. I should&#8217;ve brought the selfie stick my brother-in-law got us for Christmas. It was a cool gift even though I laughed my butt off at it.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it strange how much easier it is to wake up early on vacation? I just needed to say that. Because my butt was up EARLY&#8230;and it never is at home. I think the promise of the fun day planned ahead had me excited.</p>
<h1>Big Green Dragon, Caryville, Tennessee</h1>

<p>Don&#8217;t laugh. Ok, laugh. It&#8217;s hilarious. I saw this road side attraction on the Roadtrippers app and had to see it in person. This <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/14021?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Big Green Dinosaur</a> has been there for quite some time. You can see it from the highway. It&#8217;s now behind a Dollar General store so you have to park and walk behind the store for a picture. It&#8217;s handmade from fiber glass. It&#8217;s been there since the 1980s. Don&#8217;t judge me, I read it&#8217;s history <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/14021?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">online</a>. Anyway, it used to be for a fireworks store until the store burned down. It&#8217;s funny because it&#8217;s a fire-breathing dragon. Our Dino met the road side Dino. We had fun with this. It was also less than a mile from our hotel.</p>

<h1>World&#8217;s Fair Park, Knoxville, Tennessee</h1>
<p>Next, we drove to downtown Knoxville, Tennessee. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been downtown there. I know we drive by the big gold thingy but never have I stopped to think what it was. Well, this time was different. The big gold thingy, also known as the <a href="http://worldsfairpark.org/worlds-fair-sunsphere.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Sunsphere</a>, was going to be our next stop.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1209" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6396" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6396-e1467948314266.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 960w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>Parking downtown was a little challenging but we figured it out. The park downtown is lovely. There&#8217;s a big amphitheater where Johnny Cash and June Carter once sang. It&#8217;s big and green and relaxing. There were lots of families out and kids playing in one of the water features. There was also a kick-butt park. It had climbing walls and things you could hold onto and slide on. We walked to the <a href="http://worldsfairpark.org/worlds-fair-sunsphere.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Sunsphere.</a> It was free. At the base we just hopped on an elevator that took us up. The observation deck was cool. You can walk all the way around. There&#8217;s also history on Knoxville. That&#8217;s how I knew about the Johnny Cash thing. We were bored with it pretty quickly. I tried to hit the elevator button to take us higher (where other offices and a restaurant was) but it didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6398-e1467948499624.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1210" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6398-e1467948499624-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6398" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6398-e1467948499624-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6398-e1467948499624-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6398-e1467948499624-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6398-e1467948499624-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6398-e1467948499624.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>All and all it was a cool stop since we were driving through but I wouldn&#8217;t stop again for it. PS- It was built for The World&#8217;s Fair and most of it is still original. They charged $3pp to go up in it.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s one thing you got to know about me: I love animals. What do I like better than animals? Baby animals. What do I like better than baby animals? Nothing. Ok, I actually like feeding them. That&#8217;s why we stopped at <a href="http://thecoastertn.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Goats On The Roof</a> in Pigeon Forge. Last year we were here and road the Alpine Coaster. It was fun and thrilling. (It looks boring but it isn&#8217;t.) We went back to feed the goats who live on the roof. I&#8217;m not lying. You can feed the goats on the roof and on the ground. They also had baby goats. It was only 50 cents per cone of food. We bought 2 for $1 and fed the goats. Adorable. You can ride a bike that makes a chain move your cup up to the goats so you can feed them.</p>
<p>A tip? Walk upstairs in the shop so you can see the goats up close on the roof!</p>
<p>Our day was just beginning, but there&#8217;s much more to say in <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/one-of-the-most-magical-days-of-our-trip-hint-there-were-bears/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">another post</a>.</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been awhile since I&#8217;ve revisited and finished writing about our southern road trip that we took at the beginning of this cram-packed summer. If you forget all we did or want a recap, check out my <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/a-southern-road-trip/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">overview post</a>, which links to each day individually.</p>
<h4>If you&#8217;re here just to see awesome pictures of our biplane ride, keep scrolling!</h4>
<p>Sunday, May 31st we left <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/two-nights-at-the-yellow-house-on-plott-creek-road/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Yellow House</a>, a quaint bed and breakfast in North Carolina and headed back to Pigeon Forge for our last night on our road trip. As usual, I was looking over <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/a371a6e5-ba68-419b-8dae-d4fdaf10c876?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Groupon</a> and found a bunch of different things to do. The thing that kept hitting me was a biplane ride. Of course I talked Dustin into letting me buy us tickets. After a quick call to the pilot, we determined a time and drove to the Pigeon Forge airport.</p>
<h4><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-822" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="mainplanefirstpic" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></h4>
<p>The deal we purchased was $79 for a 15 minute biplane ride for two people. I called ahead to make sure we could redeem it that day and then purchased it with my debit card online. The owner, <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/knoxville/life/former-sailor-takes-to-the-sky-in-historic-biplane_95698627?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Marc Hightower</a>, (click on the link for a cool post about him) was welcoming and personable. He explained that business was slow and he decided to do a <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/a371a6e5-ba68-419b-8dae-d4fdaf10c876?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Groupon</a> to get more business and get his name out there.</p>

<p>In the short time we spent with him, we learned he had rebuilt this  1927 Waco Model 10 himself. It was fascinating to hear that he flies it from Key West every summer to offer rides in the Smokies. His life was just as interesting. He had lived on a boat, owned a postcard store, and currently lived in Key West. Marc took the pictures you see of us with the vintage plane. Don&#8217;t let the smile fool you&#8230;I was terrified!</p>
<p>The company he owns is called <a href="http://www.skyhighairtours.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Sky High Air Tours</a>. You can see pictures of his plane and learn more about it there.</p>

<p>We brought our camera to get lots of pictures in the air. Takeoff was simple and so was the landing. The thing that surprised me the most was how loud and windy it was. After awhile you became used to the noise and it became really cozy and relaxing. Honestly, I could see taking a nap while flying! Marc was nice enough to give us hair ties (yes, Dustin too) so that our hair didn&#8217;t get in knots.</p>

<p>Taking the bi-plane ride was one of the coolest things we&#8217;ve done together. It was really neat that it was vintage and restored. Overall I&#8217;d say it was romantic and the perfect touch to end out trip down south. The next place we stayed at wasn&#8217;t a good experience. I&#8217;ll write about that next.</p>
<h3>Would you do a bi-plane ride? Have you?</h3>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<h3>Thursday, May 28th: Downtown Gatlinburg &amp; Dinner at The Old Mill Restaurant</h3>
<p>On this day of our journey, we were still with the rest of the family. We spent the day downtown Gatlinburg. We visited the <a href="http://www.ripleys.com/gatlinburg/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Ripley&#8217;s Aquarium</a> and also did the lift at <a href="http://obergatlinburg.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Ober Gatlinburg</a>. I had been to Ripley&#8217;s. It&#8217;s an awesome aquarium and you get to go &#8220;under&#8221; the shark tank. It felt like we had a personal tour guide since my sister-in-law is studying marine biology. She told us all about the different fish and sharks. Of course, my favorite part was the penguins. There&#8217;s a newer exhibit with penguins. They&#8217;re adorable.</p>
<p>Another stop was <a href="http://www.thevillageshops.com/donutfriar.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Donut Friar</a> (located in The Village Shops). I swear this little bakery  has the very best donuts in all of the Smokeys. I had a long john, in case you were wondering. We also tried lots of beef jerky and enjoyed tasting moonshine at <a href="http://olesmoky.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Ole Smokey Tennessee Moonshine</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_604" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/label-blackberry-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-604" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/label-blackberry-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="Photo Credit: Bootleggers Homemade Wine" width="300" height="326" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/label-blackberry-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/label-blackberry-2-276x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 276w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/label-blackberry-2-28x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 28w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo Credit: Bootleggers Homemade Wine</figcaption></figure>
<p>My favorite place, though was a newer shop called <a href="http://www.bootleggerswine.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Bootleggers Homemade Wine</a>. This little shop sells wines that are extra sweet and have unique flavors. After tasting a few, we picked up a bottle of Homegrown Blackberry Wine to enjoy at our bed and breakfast. My in-laws picked up some Homegrown Strawberry Wine for a friend. Cute country t-shirts and glass mason jars are sold in the store. I really liked the packaging of the wines. The winery began with two sisters and they make all of their wines by hand. You can&#8217;t order online, you have to visit the location in the Smokeys to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ve heard lots about <a href="http://obergatlinburg.com/aerial-tramway/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Ober Gatlinburg</a> but I&#8217;d never been there. It&#8217;s basically an attraction park at the top of a mountain overlooking downtown Gatlinburg. In the winter you can ski or tube up there. Along with kiddie rides, there are animals on display and restaurants. We took the ariel tram too late in the evening and didn&#8217;t spend time up there. The view was wonderful. I&#8217;ll admit, being on the tram was a little bit scary, but it was fun to walk around and look into the mountains. Per person it was $12. It takes you 2.1 miles up into the mountains and can take 120 passengers. The Aerial Tramway at Ober Gatlinburg is also one of the largest in all of America.</p>

<p>Last, but definitely not least, we ate at <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/info/the-old-mill-restaurant?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Old Mill Restaurant</a> for dinner. This is one of my favorite restaurants on the planet and we make a point to eat there every time we are in town. Located in Pigeon Forge, this restaurant is one of the oldest attractions in the area. The food is ah-mazing. We&#8217;re talking Southern fritters, homemade chicken and dumplings, and lots of sweet tea.</p>
<p>For about $20 you receive</p>
<p>-a cup of corn chowder</p>
<p>-a side salad</p>
<p>-corn fritters</p>
<p>-an entree</p>
<p>-mashed potatoes and green beans</p>
<p>-dinner rolls</p>
<p>-homemade dessert</p>
<p>I was in food heaven. The chicken and dumplings were delicious. Made just like I like them. Dustin ordered the meatloaf. It was at least a pound in weight. Massive. We all had leftovers, including desserts. It&#8217;s safe to say we slept well that night on full bellies.</p>
<h3>Friday, May 29th: Alpine Coaster, Working from Starbucks &amp; Headed to The Yellow House Bed and Breakfast</h3>

<p>The next morning, we said goodbye to our family and they headed back to Ohio. I had found tickets for an alpine coaster on Groupon for $17 for two. The attraction was located at <a href="http://thecoastertn.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Goats on the Roof.</a> This center had games, rides, and a gift shop&#8230;it also had live goats living on the roof. I didn&#8217;t believe it at fist, thought it was just a sales gimmick, until we saw goats walking around on the roof. Above is the picture of where the goats live. There are connecting walkways to each building and the goats can walk around up and down the buildings and hide in the little barns. For a dollar you could buy food and use a mechanism to feed them on the roof. This was hilarious as the goats would anticipate the food and crane their necks to eat it. <strong>But, we weren&#8217;t there to feed the goats. We were there to ride the alpine coaster. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/alpinecoasterpf.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-591" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/alpinecoasterpf-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="alpinecoasterpf" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/alpinecoasterpf.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/alpinecoasterpf-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/alpinecoasterpf-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/alpinecoasterpf-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>An alpine coaster is basically a small roller coaster, only you have a hand held break which helps you slow down. The little cart is attached to a track and once you go up the mountain, you are let go and roll around circles and hills until you slow to a stop at the bottom. Dustin and I thought this would be easy peasy. Not scary at all. We love roller coasters and have been to Cedar Points lots of times. Well, it wasn&#8217;t a walk in the park. As soon as we began gaining speed I was hollering and Dustin was pulling the break. Even though you were wearing seat belts, it felt like you could fly off the side of the mountain. It was really fun and the dips caught your stomach. Well worth the $17. I&#8217;d do it again!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was time to work. We both had stuff to get done. After finding a Starbucks, we ordered drinks and hunkered down. It would be a few hours before we could leave and drive to our first bed and breakfast.</p>
<p>Once we finished up, we looked up the directions to Waynesville. The drive was about an hour and a half. We passed some fun places, including the home of <a href="http://www.bushbeans.com/en_US/visitors-center?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Bush&#8217;s Baked Beans</a>.</p>
<p>Next up, the best bed and breakfast we&#8217;ve ever visited. The Yellow House!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>As promised, I will be breaking down our southern road trip. We began our trip on Monday, May 25th with family. To see the whole trip overview <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/a-southern-road-trip/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">click here</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Monday, May 25th: Cumberland Falls </strong></h3>
<p>While driving down to Pigeon Forge, we stopped at <a href="http://parks.ky.gov/parks/resortparks/cumberland-falls/history.aspx?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Cumberland Falls</a>. Located in the Daniel Boone National Forest near Corbin, Kentucky, this falls is a popular destination for those wanting to see the moonbow (a rainbow seen under a full moon). We visited during the afternoon and hiked about two-three miles. It was really hot and humid, but it was a good hike and the falls were worth the trek. You can also just drive straight up to the falls.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fallsinkydustinshot.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-551" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fallsinkydustinshot-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="fallsinkydustinshot" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fallsinkydustinshot.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fallsinkydustinshot-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fallsinkydustinshot-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fallsinkydustinshot-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Do you see the small raft in the corner of the picture? It helps you get an idea of how big the falls are. The rocks at the bottom are really large. I learned there was once a hotel overlooking the water but it burned down 1949.</p>

<p>After hiking, we drove to Knoxville, TN. We stayed the night at the Hampton Inn. I love Hampton Inns. This one had a salt water pool! The next morning, we woke up and drove into the Smoky Mountain National Park.</p>

<h3><strong>Tuesday, May 26th: Smoky Mountain National Park, Cherokee Village, the Cabin </strong></h3>
<p>On Tuesday we woke up and drove into the Smoky Mountain National Park. Together, it was me, my dad, Dustin&#8217;s mum and dad, his brother,  his little sister, and Dustin. We stopped at an overlook and took the picture below of Gatlinburg. I&#8217;ve stayed at the hotel that&#8217;s higher up. It&#8217;s also where my little sister stayed on her honeymoon. It&#8217;s currently owned by Hilton and is called <a href="http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/tennessee/the-park-vista-a-doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-gatlinburg-GKTPVDT/index.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Park Vista by Doubletree</a>. It&#8217;s really cool and has a 15-story atrium.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smokeymountainsoverlookgatliburg.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-568" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smokeymountainsoverlookgatliburg-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="smokeymountainsoverlookgatliburg" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smokeymountainsoverlookgatliburg.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smokeymountainsoverlookgatliburg-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smokeymountainsoverlookgatliburg-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smokeymountainsoverlookgatliburg-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Along with stopping a the park&#8217;s visitors center, we hiked to Laurel Falls. After that, we drove over the mountain to <a href="http://visitcherokeenc.com/#home?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Cherokee</a> in North Carolina. I remember visiting this little village when I was a small girl. It&#8217;s on an Indian reservation and has many different shops. It seemed a little run down and there weren&#8217;t many people there. Just going over the mountain was worth the trip, but I probably wouldn&#8217;t suggest going to Cherokee unfortunately. It just isn&#8217;t how it used to be.</p>
<p>After Cherokee, we drove back over the mountain and found our cabin! The cabin was rented through <a href="http://www.cabinsofthesmokymountains.com/gatlinburg-cabin-rental/Love_View_More.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Cabins of the Smoky Mountains</a>. Since we were staying in May, we received a great discount. I believe it was less than $300 per night and we stayed three nights. Dad and Dustin&#8217;s dad and mum shared the cost of the cabin. Dustin and I later contributed by paying for everyone&#8217;s aerial tram ride, which was about $85. The actual cabin name was Love View More.</p>

<p>The cabin was massive. It&#8217;s probably one of the nicest places I&#8217;ve ever stayed. Five balconies, four massive bedrooms, five bathrooms, a theater room, a game room, and more.</p>

<p>We spent a lot of time on the front porch, which was attached to the living room and dining room. The view was spectacular. I can&#8217;t even describe it.</p>

<p>Above is a picture of the view from the front porch. We all got a private bedroom except Dustin&#8217;s siblings who shared. Each bedroom had it&#8217;s own bathroom, some with double sinks. The master suite was Dustin&#8217;s parents room. It had it&#8217;s own private balcony, a garden tub, vaulted ceilings, and a master bathroom.</p>

<p>Dustin and I picked the bedroom in the basement. There were glass doors that led to the hot tub on the bottom level. There was also a private bathroom attached. I loved the king sized bed and the decorations were really fun. We had plenty of room!</p>

<p>Below is a picture of one of the other bedrooms. When we arrived the towels were folded. I loved the exposed beams and wood. Each bedroom also had a flat screen tv.</p>

<p>Two of the four bedrooms had their own private decks. Our bedroom had a door that opened to a communal deck. Below is a picture of the dual sinks in one of the bathrooms.</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t spend that much time in the family room. Instead, we found ourselves at the dining room table, out on the porches, or playing in the game room. Although this room was wonderful. The TV (not pictured) was massive and the couches were comfy. The kitchen was well equipped and even had an ice maker appliance built under one of the cabinets. I loved the granite countertops and the space. One morning our dads combined forces and made us a yummy breakfast. Other than that, we just snacked. We dined out more.</p>

<p>The game room and movie room were decorated with fun art, including a <em>Gone with the Wind</em> movie poster.</p>

<p>A lot of time was spent playing pool and arcade games. The arcade machine had lots of different vintage games and use was unlimited. The boys (and everyone else) couldn&#8217;t stay away from it! We turned on the fireplace a few times. It was really cozy.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, we didn&#8217;t really use the theater room. It had it&#8217;s own bathroom and was such a cool thing to have in the cabin. We all love movies, but we were pretty busy seeing the sights. One night we just watched TV down there before bed. The sound system was good and the picture clear. (Love that <em>Grease</em> poster).</p>

<h3>Wednesday, May 27th: Poison Ivy Scare &amp; Dixie Stampede</h3>
<p>Every morning Dustin and I would wake up and try to get some work in. On Wednesday, Dustin was breaking out in poison ivy. We were unsure of how bad it was until his eyes began to swell. After a trip to Urgent Care and $200+ in medical bills, we were glad we paid attention. I guess Dustin is extremely allergic to poison ivy and it had gotten into his bloodstream. The doctor at Urgent Care gave him a shot and watched him until his swelling went down. His tongue was tingling and his lips were swollen. The doctor told us if it got any worse he needed to get to the ER. She gave us directions, but with steroids he got a little better.</p>
<p>That evening we got to go to <a href="http://www.dixiestampede.com/pigeon-forge?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Dixie Stampede</a>. Was it corny? A little. Was it fun? YES! I&#8217;ve been three times now and I love it. Headed up by Dolly Parton, this attraction is fun for all ages and includes a full meal. You eat with your hands &#8220;country style&#8221; and watch a show. There are live animals like horses, pigs, mini ponies, bison, and more. The tricks are cool and they&#8217;ve added a woman who flies around attached to invisible cords, representing a Native American bird. The service was great and our waiter took good care of us, making sure we had lots of sweet tea.</p>
<p>I was so full at the end. The <a href="http://www.dixiestampede.com/pigeon-forge/four-course-dinner?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">amount of food</a> is so big. You get a cheesy roll, a bowl of creamy vegetable soup, half a baked potato, a whole chicken, BBQ pork loin, corn-on-the-cob, and an apple turnover. The chicken is really strange (because it&#8217;s an entire chicken) when they lay it on your plate, but it&#8217;s delicious. There are wet wipes for your hands too.</p>
<p>For $60, it&#8217;s a bit of a splurge, but it was fun for the whole family and the horse  tricks were worth seeing. Look around for coupons!</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s enough of our trip for this post. (And that&#8217;s only three days!) Next, we had a few more days with the family and then headed off on our own.</p>
