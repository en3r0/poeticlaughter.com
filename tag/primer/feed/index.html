<p>I&#8217;m still catching up! I received <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=1dr1&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">June&#8217;s Ipsy bag </a>and have had the pictures waiting to be published.</p>
<h3>The bag wasn&#8217;t horrible, but it wasn&#8217;t the best bag I&#8217;ve had from them.</h3>
<p>There were about three things I really loved. To begin, the bag was an interesting material. It has &#8220;ipsy&#8221; all over it with a top orangish colored zipper closure. I personally thought it was ugly so I&#8217;ll be passing it on to someone else. The most recognizable branded item was the <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EG07BM0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00EG07BM0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=UI42YDEPDRUZGQIX&quot;&gt;Smashbox&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Photo Finish OIL-FREE Foundation Primer .25 fl. oz (DLX Travel Size) NEW!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00EG07BM0&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;">Smashbox Cosmetics Photo Finish Foundation Primer</a>. As you can see, it isn&#8217;t pictured because I used it up! The other brand I recognized was <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FSD402I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00FSD402I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=3OMMU4ZF473BVDOF&quot;&gt;Lavanila&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss The Healthy Body Butter: Pure Vanilla - 6.7 oz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00FSD402I&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;">Lavanilla</a>. I was happy to get this sample because I&#8217;ve wanted to try their lotions.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsysummerboxopen.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-725" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsysummerboxopen-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="ipsysummerboxopen" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsysummerboxopen.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsysummerboxopen-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsysummerboxopen-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsysummerboxopen-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of what I received and their values!</p>
<h3>Smashbox Cosmetics Photo Finish Foundation Primer, $8</h3>
<p>This was an exciting sample for me. I love <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DJ57GHS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00DJ57GHS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=I2KS74VFZEOLZZGB&quot;&gt;Smashbox&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Try It Kit: Halo + BB Light/Medium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00DJ57GHS&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank">Smashbox Cosmetics</a> and this primer helps your makeup stay on forever. It feels really slippery and fills in all your pores. It basically perfects your skin before putting on other layers. It&#8217;s also good for oil-prone skin like mine!</p>
<h3>Pure Vanilla The Healthy Body Butter Instant Hydration by Lavanila Laboratories, $4</h3>
<p>This sample was wonderful. The warm scent of the vanilla was really strong and it stayed on my skin. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t find it as moisturizing as I&#8217;d hoped. It didn&#8217;t seem to make my hands softer in the long run. What I do love about this brand is that it&#8217;s 100% all natural. I wouldn&#8217;t buy a full sized item, but I&#8217;d welcome more samples of other scents.</p>
<h3>tre&#8217;StiQue Mini Shadow Crayon in Kona Coffee, $10</h3>
<p>This is a brand that Ipsy has been including lately. I think this is the first item I received from them. It was OK. Nothing too spectacular. I liked the shape of the crayon and the pigmentation was alright. It&#8217;s one of those products that isn&#8217;t worth the crazy high price tag for the quality. A full size is $26. I&#8217;d rather buy shadow crayons from more established brands for that price. <strong>I haven&#8217;t used it once since June.Â </strong></p>

<h3>Liptitude Hydrating Lip Stain by J.Cat Beauty, $5.99</h3>
<p>When I first saw this lip color, I thought it was a throw-in and nothing special. The color looked OK, but the name, Liptitude, seemed juvenile. When I opened it, I decided to try it. The color was fantastic! My husband even said it looked great on. I think the shade I received was called <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0100SY1OW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0100SY1OW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=YWC4QK43BT63IPGZ&quot;&gt;J&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Cat Liptitude Lip Stain 115 Blow Your Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0100SY1OW&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank">Blow Your Mind</a>. My mum saw it on me and also wanted one. Eventually I noticed it did move around on my lips. The color stayed, since it&#8217;s a stain, but I had trouble keeping it in place. The formula was thick and a little messy. Since I liked the shade so much, I think I&#8217;ll try it with a clear lip liner. Overall, I liked the sample, but won&#8217;t buy it since it was a little messy and had a strange smell.</p>

<h3>BioRepublic Soothing Fiber Masks (3), $14.95</h3>
<p>Three masks! Woohoo! That&#8217;s a great &#8220;one item.&#8221; A set of three masks is valued at $14.95. In the picture there is one missing because I tried it the night I opened the bag. Overall these masks worked well. They seemed to help with my irritated skin and smelled really great. I don&#8217;t think they work as well as <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MXQEFQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004MXQEFQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=BKLMQXKPA44RWGXJ&quot;&gt;Karuna&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Clarifying + Face Mask, 0.95 fl. oz.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004MXQEFQ&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank">Karuna</a> masks or <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009GYVMAS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B009GYVMAS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=X5QV2YK55CD2BC5N&quot;&gt;GLAMGLOW&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Super-MudTM Clearing Treatment 1.2 oz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B009GYVMAS&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank">GlamGlow</a>, but they were the perfect addition for the June bag.<a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZIS507C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00ZIS507C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=ODC6QLI6ZJMB5UWH&quot;&gt;BioRepublic&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Skincare Cucumber Breeze 3 Mask Set&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00ZIS507C&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank"> BioRepublic</a> is a really interesting brand. It was developed by Americans who traveled in Asia. The website says,</p>
<p>&#8220;Not being ones to accept the status quo, Justin and Paolo immediately set out to create their own line of sheet masks, inspired by Korean products but formulated with American tastes and values. Now theyâre bringing their masks to you, without parabens, sulfates, pthalates, or triclosan. 100% cruelty-free. Â Dermatologist tested and totally <a title="BioRepublic SkinCare - Ingredient Safety" href="http://www.biorepublic.com/pages/ingredient-safety?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">transparent</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t tried a sheet mask yet, you should! They work really well and are inexpensive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsyjunecucumbermasks.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-724" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsyjunecucumbermasks-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="ipsyjunecucumbermasks" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsyjunecucumbermasks.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsyjunecucumbermasks-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsyjunecucumbermasks-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipsyjunecucumbermasks-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Overall I liked my bag. I don&#8217;t have a lot of complaints because I feel as if I got my $10 worth of products. I loved the masks and the primer. Did you get this bag? What have you been using since June? If you give it some time, then you learn what you really use on a regular basis and prefer!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>

<p>I about peed my pants when I found out I was selected to try the latest makeup line from <a href="http://www.ysl.com/us?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Yves Saint Laurent</a>! For those that don&#8217;t know, the brand is pretty pricey and is offered from the world-famous luxury brand. Personally, I&#8217;ve tried a handful of samples from YSL, but I&#8217;ve never tried any full sized items.</p>
<p>So, how did I receive this crazy nice makeup swag? Well, I&#8217;ve been a member of <a href="https://www.influenster.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Influenster </a>for about three years now. This program is online and allows different people to try new products and give feedback. Now, it helps that I have a lot of Facebook friends and have my own beauty blog. I think that&#8217;s why they send me more makeup than others. The program is completely free and I&#8217;m not paid to say anything in particular about the brands. In the past I&#8217;ve tried razors, makeup items, and even vitamins! This package is by far the highest valued item I&#8217;ve been sent and it made my day! I plan on writing a post later about how to become an Influenster and what to do to get sent some of the higher value items to sample. In the meantime, if you&#8217;re curious, just click <a href="https://www.influenster.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">here</a> and begin working on your profile and connecting your social media to the site.</p>

<p>Before I received this box, I received an email with a set of questions to answer. I answered that I loved makeup and was a Very Important Beauty Insider at <a href="http://www.sephora.com/?&amp;om_mmc=ppc-GG&amp;mkwid=sGT137elx&amp;pcrid=68913499937&amp;pdv=c&amp;site=us_search&amp;country_switch=us&amp;lang=en&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwr8uuBRCcg6-s-4TrmIsBEiQAN1TdEYff65jvto8nmfAqw811Cx0ItjCqJedqih4CRHRBdscaAg8v8P8HAQ&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Sephora</a> (I send $350+ per year there). Once I finished the set of questions, I received a confirmation email that I was receiving the box. It came a few days later and looked like this.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactinfluenster.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-765" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactinfluenster-1024x716.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="yslcompactinfluenster" width="1024" height="716" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactinfluenster.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactinfluenster-300x210.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactinfluenster-768x537.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yslcompactinfluenster-30x21.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Inside the box were two different YSL products and an insert with information about the Touch Eclat Blur line. The two main products were <a href="http://www.sephora.com/touche-eclat-blur-primer-P397615?skuId=1713114&amp;icid2=brand:yves%20saint%20laurent__p397615_image&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Touche Eclat Blur Primer</a> and the <a href="http://www.sephora.com/touche-eclat-blur-perfector-P397617?skuId=1713122&amp;icid2=brand:yves%20saint%20laurent__p397617_image&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Touch Eclat Blur Perfector</a>.</p>

<h2>Yves Saint Laurent Touch Eclat Blue Perfector</h2>
<p>When I opened the packaging I swear I had hearts in my eyes. The compact is Â beautiful and very luxurious to hold. The packaging is a pale pink with the iconic YSL logo in gold. Once you open the rectangular compact, there is a mirror and then the product. So, what in the world is this pink formula supposed to do?</p>
<p>According to Sephora, the product is a blur perfector. This means that the formula will help matte-ify your skin, blur overlarge pores, and give you a warm glow. The exact description says</p>
<p>&#8220;This portable perfector is Yves Saint Laurentâs first ever blur perfector encased within a compact. It transforms from a balm to a powder upon application to soften the skinâs imperfectionsâcreating a transparent yet subtle, rosy-glow effect. Use it alone as an allover complexion perfector, to set makeup, or as a mattifying touch up to sweep away shine and hide imperfections. Featuring one universal shade that complements all skin types, it instantly minimizes the look of pores so that skin feels smoother and the complexion appears more even. &#8221;</p>
<p>So, what did I think? Even though the packaging was beautiful&#8230;<strong>I didn&#8217;t like it</strong>. As soon as I opened it, I applied it on top of my <a href="http://www.sephora.com/lock-it-tattoo-foundation-P311138?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Kat Von D Lock It Tattoo</a> foundation. The formula from YSL didn&#8217;t mix well and basically made my makeup come off. I noticed the liquid makeup separated and drew even more attention to my large pores (sigh).</p>
<p>I thought maybe it was how it mixed with my foundation. I tried another day by wearing it alone. I didn&#8217;t notice a big difference, but my husband said my pores around my nose did seem smaller.</p>
<p>You use a sponge to apply the cream which then turns into a powder. The formula feels great going on and seems to eliminate oil. Unfortunately, I wear liquid makeup almost everyday. This type of product doesn&#8217;t work well with my go-to foundation so I won&#8217;t have a need for it. Along with trying it all over on top of my foundation, I also used it under and it did the same thing. Another time I only used it near my oily t-zone and again, it didn&#8217;t deliver. It was super disappointing for such an expensive and beautiful product. On Sephora, a lot of beauty lovers are saying they&#8217;re addicted to it. Perhaps it works better with other foundations? I may try to mix it with my <a href="http://www.clinique.com/product/1599/6201/Makeup/Foundations/Almost-Powder-Makeup-Broad-Spectrum-SPF-15?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Clinique Almost Powder Makeup</a>Â on a day when I&#8217;m not doing a full face of makeup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sephora.com/touche-eclat-blur-perfector-P397617?skuId=1713122&amp;icid2=brand:yves%20saint%20laurent__p397617_image&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">YSL Touch Eclat Blue Perfector</a> cam be purchased at Sephora for $55. If you didn&#8217;t get the hint already, I won&#8217;t be purchasing it. I feel as if there isn&#8217;t a need for this in my day-to-day makeup routine.</p>

<h2>Yves Saint Laurent Touch Eclat Blur Primer</h2>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve found my new favorite primer! After the disappointment of the compact, I was beginning to think Yves Saint Laurent products weren&#8217;t as great as I thought they were supposed to be. Thankfully, the primer proved me wrong. I received the primer from Influenster and it was a small sample size. The container has a gold top and has small flecks of gold suspended in the liquid. You apply it with a small sponge applicator. Overall, the product is supposed to help your makeup go on smooth, blur complexion imperfections, and give you a healthy glow. Sephora says,</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.sephora.com/touche-eclat-blur-primer-P397615?skuId=1713114&amp;icid2=brand:yves%20saint%20laurent__p397615_image&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Touche Elcat Blur Primer</a> preps skin for foundation application, creating an improved, refined appearance: pores seem to be minimized, skin texture feels smoother, and skintone is more even. Itâs enriched with four nourishing oilsâcorn oil, apricot kernel oil, passiflora oil, and rice bran oilâto leave skin feeling incredibly soft without a greasy residue. Packed with blur technology, this universal primer provides a subtle, golden shimmer for ultimate luminosity. &#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Boy, did this help my makeup stay put!</strong> It worked beautifully under my Kat Von D foundation (unlike the compact version) and made my skin look flawless. I even received a few compliments on my skin when wearing it. The gold flecks are interesting. I didn&#8217;t see them on my skin. I suppose they blend in? The formula is very silky. I felt like I needed a lot to cover my entire face. It absorbs quickly and helps acne stars look less noticeable. I&#8217;ve purchased <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/lancome-la-base-pro-perfecting-makeup-primer/2992830?cm_mmc=Google_Product_Ads_pla_online-_-datafeed-_-women:makeup:foundation-_-235900&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwr8uuBRCcg6-s-4TrmIsBEiQAN1TdEaEaNimtycUaQr3llCbTPb4IVdsELq2roZkrqe9_hsoaAmyi8P8HAQ&amp;mr:referralID=2ec03cf7-460c-11e5-8a28-0050569451e5&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Lancomes&#8217; LA BASE PRO</a> for $42 in the past. I would say the Yves Saint Laurent Touche Eclat Blur Primer works a tad bit better. It seemed to keep my makeup on just as long and go on just as smooth. The difference is that the YSL product helped my skin have a healthy glow. The Lancome primer didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Touche Eclat Blur Primer is $52 for one ounce of product. It&#8217;s a little bit larger than Lancome&#8217;s (.2 ounces more). I think trying this through Influenster has definitely won me over. I saw a promotion at Sephora to receive a deluxe sample of the primer. I spent some money just to get another container of it! Now, can I get myself to invest in a $36 <a href="http://www.sephora.com/rouge-pur-couture-satin-radiance-lipstick-P272319?skuId=1293463&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">YSL lipstick</a>? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="ð" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I received both products FREE through <a href="https://www.influenster.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Influenster</a> for testing purposes. My opinions are, of course, my own. If I like something, I&#8217;ll let you know. If I think it&#8217;s a waste of a dollar&#8230;I&#8217;ll let you know that, too.</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>I received the April Glambag this past month and I was super disappointed. Even before getting it in the mail, I received an email that said that the MICA Beauty eye primer had some discoloration in it. Nonetheless, I held out, hoping the bag would still deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler Alert: It didn&#8217;t.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always heard other beauty lovers complain about their subscription purchases and I thought it was absurd. It&#8217;s cheap makeup and risk is involved&#8230;so don&#8217;t complain. Just cancel. <strong>Well, after this month I was a little more understanding.Â </strong>Here&#8217;s what I received in my bag, and why I can&#8217;t be too happy with it this month.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tintedlipandblushclosed.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-474" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tintedlipandblushclosed-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="tintedlipandblushclosed" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tintedlipandblushclosed.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tintedlipandblushclosed-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Mullein &amp; Sparrow All Natural Tinted Lip and Cheek Balm, Sample Size, Valued at $8</strong></p>
<p>This product had me really excited for this bag. I really like anything from Etsy sellers and love supporting small businesses. Unfortunately this product didn&#8217;t have any pigment. As you can see in the swatches, there wasn&#8217;t any color. The smell was delicious. It reminded me of citrus. Some members of Ipsy said they were going to use it as a perfume. I think this was an OK idea. Unfortunately I haven&#8217;t even reached for it since I reviewed it. The design on the front is beautiful and the concept is cool but it just didn&#8217;t work.</p>

<h3>Wind Blown 05 Dry Finishing Spray by Redken, Sample Size, Valued at $10</h3>
<p>This sample was probably my favorite item in the bag. I like Redken products and I&#8217;ve used this a few times since receiving it. The finishing spray is supposed to hold your hair and also help it look more polished. Overall it wasn&#8217;t something I&#8217;d purchase myself, but I&#8217;m glad to have it.</p>

<h3>theBalm Cosmetics Eye Shadow in Flirty, Sample valued at $1.50-$2</h3>
<p>I was bummed about the size of this sample. I like theBalm, which is sold at Ulta and other stores, but this sample was so tiny. The color was ok but I have other shades similar. The individual eye shadow comes in a magnetic little package. Of course I think the packaging is cute though.</p>

<h3>MicaBeauty Eye Primer, Sample Size, Value $12</h3>
<p>Oh, this was a big oopsidaisi from Ipsy. Right before I was mailed out my bag I received a message saying that the MicaBeauty Primer was discolored. I&#8217;m a member of an online makeup forum and many members were saying they found mold in their product. Now, Ipsy swears that it&#8217;s just discoloration but I wasn&#8217;t too confident. Once I received it I looked it over. Even though it looked alright to use, I was weary. I emailed the help desk and was responded to quickly. They told me that they understood my concern and offered another sample with its own shipping tracking code. I threw the primer away and within a week had another item in the mail. I was shocked that they sent me a <strong>full sized</strong> Oscar Blandi Pronto Texture and Volume Spray. I plan on offering a full review on this product later. I was really pleased with the quick response and customer service. This has made me more confident with my subscription and I&#8217;m super glad I haven&#8217;t cancelled.</p>

<h3>JulieG Nail Color in Damsel, Full-size $3.99</h3>
<p>The color is pretty for spring but I&#8217;m not a fan of the formula. It has formaldehyde in it, which is pretty bad for you. Now, I do use a lot of different nail polishes, some of which may not be 100% natural, but this worried me. It&#8217;s a cheaper brand from Wallgreens and I&#8217;m picky about what I put on my nails. Overall, I decided not to use this. I&#8217;ll probably give it to someone. The color is pretty though, too bad I don&#8217;t know what it looks like on.</p>

<h3>Overall: It Was the Worst Bag I&#8217;ve Ever Received</h3>
<p>I was shocked when I received this. It was the worst bag I&#8217;ve ever received from Ipsy. The bag itself was cute but the items just didn&#8217;t seem worth the price. Some people loved this bag and I think it might be a matter of preference. I won&#8217;t really use the eyeshadow, the primer, the tint, or the nail polish. I&#8217;ve used the hair product and liked it and I also used the bag when I went to the beach. It&#8217;s been a few months since I&#8217;ve taken the pictures and I still think this is a pretty bad bag&#8230;but I&#8217;m happy with the full-sized product they sent me.</p>
<p>This made me keep subscribing and of course I&#8217;ve been super happy with the products ever since.</p>

<p>When isnât it a good time to do a makeup haul? Well, I canât think of a better time than to celebrate my little sisterâs February wedding. Iâm the Matron of Honor and will be doing her makeup and mine! While my mum was getting her eyes done at the <a href="http://www.lancome-usa.com/special_offers/special_offers,default,sc.html?cm_mmc=LabeliumSearch-_-GoogleBrand-_-Brand-_-lancome&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Lancome</a> counter, of course I had to purchase a few items too.</p>
<p>What really convinced me to splurge was the gift promotion they were having. If you spent $35, youâd receive a bag filled with makeup goodies that totaled up to about $70! I remember when I was a little girl going to the mall with my mum when she purchased Lancome makeup. As one of their promotions, they would <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19860713&amp;id=RoYfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ps4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4740,6577813&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">give you a loaf of French bread</a> and a tote bag. Looking back, it seems so strange to give out a loaf of take-home-to-bake bread with purchase, but it solidified the idea that Lancome was a French brand! I stopped writing this post to call my mum and ask her about it. She began laughing as we reminisced. SheÂ said that when sheâd get her makeup from the booth, weâd always have a meal that went with French bread that evening! How neat! Long gone are the days when you receive a loaf of bread with purchase, but the company always has gift promotions that include makeup bonuses!</p>
<p>For the main item, I purchased a primer that Iâd been wanting to try for awhile: the <a href="http://www.lancome-usa.com/La-Base-Pro/1000205,default,pd.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">LA Base Pro</a>.</p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-la-base-pro.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="  aligncenter wp-image-46" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-la-base-pro-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="lancome-la-base-pro" width="449" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-la-base-pro-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 678w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-la-base-pro-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-la-base-pro-768x1160.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-la-base-pro-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lancome-la-base-pro-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p>This primer from Lancome is designed to help your makeup look perfect for photos (and in person). What really sold me on it was the texture. The product feels like silk and isnât sticky or thick. La Base Pro is supposed to help your makeup look more vibrant while helping it stay put! I especially liked the products ability to diffuse light, reducing lines and imperfections. I have pretty large pores and have tried a lot of different primers. What this product did was smooth my skin and help it look much less oily during the day. Pricey at $42, this is an item I consider a beauty investment.</p>
<p>[Update]</p>
<p>I was pleased with the primer and used it on my sister for her wedding (and on me!) I noticed that her pores looked a lot better when it was applied and that her foundation went on much smoother. It was hard to measure how well it made her makeup last because she usually doesn&#8217;t wear foundation.</p>
<p>My skin, however, looked really great during the wedding and during photos. I kept some concealer and a beauty blender in my purse and only needed about two touch-ups. I have acne and uneven skin tones. The base really helped create a smooth surface for my blush and bronzer. Since I&#8217;ve been wearing LA Base Pro I&#8217;ve even gotten a few compliments on my skin. Muahah&#8230;if they even knew!</p>
<p>Included in the gift was a choice of makeup bag and many other goodies. Hereâs a breakdown!</p>

<p>I picked out this adorable makeup bag with my gift. There were two others to choose from but I loved the stripes and teal color. It reminded me of <a href="http://www.katespade.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Shop-Site/en_US/Home-Show?D1=2270606&amp;affcode=401343&amp;cm_mmc=Google-_-Brand-Search|Kate_Spade_Kate_Spade|Exact-_-e%20Ad_38542903053-_-Kate%20spade&amp;searchdef=2270606&amp;k_clickid=73f806af-98c4-6b88-9356-000056eae926&amp;002=2270606&amp;006=38542903053&amp;007=Search&amp;008=&amp;009=e&amp;012=Kate%20spade&amp;021=50465828493&amp;025=c&amp;026=&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=kate%20spade&amp;utm_content=kate_spade|exact&amp;utm_campaign=brand-search|kate_spade&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Kate Spade.</a> The zipper has aÂ flower with a crystal.

<p><strong><a href="http://www.sephora.com/definicils-high-definition-mascara-P54450?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Definicils Mascara</a>Â in black</strong></p>
<p>I almost purchased a full size of this mascara, but I&#8217;ll be honest, I&#8217;m waiting for <a href="http://www.sephora.com/roller-lash-P392516?skuId=1665082&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Benefit&#8217;s Roller Lash mascara</a> which is coming out at the end of February. Â I always seem to have trouble with my bottom lashes. Mascara rubs off and gives me raccoon eyes. I told my mum this and she said that she was in love with <a href="http://www.lancome-usa.com/Definicils/76805,default,pd.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Definicils</a> and it doesn&#8217;t smear. When our friend (a Lancome rep) brought out the primer, I was sold&#8230;but I was happy to get a sample of this in my gift. Mum was right: the product stays on and doesn&#8217;t rub. I&#8217;m impressed. I like this better for my lower lashes than my holy grail mascara: <a href="http://www.sephora.com/they-re-real-mascara-P289307?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Benefit&#8217;s They&#8217;re Real</a>. Mixing both products seemed to give off the best results. Definicils on my bottom and Benefit&#8217;s on the top.</p>
<p>Although mum said she liked Definicils, a few friends talked her into trying the newest mascara from Lancome: <a href="http://www.lancome-usa.com/Grandiose/990777,default,pd.html?dwvar_990777_color=Noir%20Mirifique&amp;cgid=makeup-mascara&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Grandoise</a>. I tried hers and liked it. The curved &#8220;swan neck&#8221; applicator helps you get every individual lash.</p>

<p>This product is a holy grail for many makeup addicts! I&#8217;ve never purchased a full size because I always get them free in bonus gifts. Right before my sisters&#8217; wedding, I used this to clean my<a href="http://www.beautyblender.net/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank"> beauty blender</a>. Let me tell you, it worked phenomenal. The makeup that had been inside the sponge grossed me out. I kept pouring the makeup remover on the sponge and running it under hot water until it looked like new! I haven&#8217;t yet had a chance to use the makeup remover on my face, but if it works half as good as it did on the makeup sponge, I&#8217;ll be impressed.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.lancome-usa.com/Bienfait-Multi-Vital-SPF-30-Cream/990785,default,pd.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Bienfait Multi-Vital SPF 30 Cream</a></strong></p>
<p>I always get excited about lipsticks and other items in my gift but this was a pleasant surprise. With 30 SPF, you can&#8217;t go wrong with this indulgent moisturizer. Although I&#8217;m partial to <a href="http://www.lushusa.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">LUSH</a> products, I&#8217;ve been using this in the morning before I put on theÂ LA Base Pro Primer. The sample came with a lot of product and it didn&#8217;t feel too heavy on my skin. It smelled really fresh. I still prefer my LUSH moisturizer called <a href="http://www.lushusa.com/Celestial/9999900407,en_US,pd.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Celestial</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www1.bloomingdales.com/shop/product/lancome-color-fever-gloss-sensual-vibrant-lipshine?ID=87572&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Lancome Color Fever Gloss Sensual Vibrant LipSine in Hot Number</a></strong></p>
<p>This gloss was underwhelming. Nothing too great. Just a simple lip gloss. It has little color payoff and a lot of shimmer. Although this girl loves glitter, the product just wasn&#8217;t something I got too excited about. I did, however, put some on when heading to the church for my sister&#8217;s wedding (before I did my makeup). I really love the packaging and the application wand is nice. The smell reminds me of chemicals. If you like lip shimmer that&#8217;s a little pigmented, this may be your go-to &#8220;no makeup &#8220;makeup gloss.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.lancome-usa.com/Blush-Subtil/746230,default,pd.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">BLUSH SUBTIL Powder Blush in Shimmer Pink PoolÂ </a></strong></p>
<p>This blush rocks. The packaging is really nice and I like the mirror which makes for easy application. Blush Subtil is oil-free and is a powder blush. The shimmer is the right amount and the color is a pretty pink &#8211; perfect for my skin tone! I don&#8217;t go through blushes too quickly so I think this will last me a long time. I like applying it with a peachy lipgloss and light eye makeup for a &#8220;fresh-face&#8221; look.</p>
<h2>Overall: It was a pricy investment.</h2>
<p>I do love picking up products that I know will last me a long time and will help my makeup stay on longer. Honestly, I wouldn&#8217;t have purchased the LA Base Pro if it hadn&#8217;t been for the bonus items and my sisters&#8217; upcoming wedding. (They get you with those bonuses!) I&#8217;m pleased with the product but I&#8217;m not sure how other brands would compare since I&#8217;ve never purchased a full-sized face primer. I&#8217;ve used samples of Smashbox&#8217;s Photo Finish Primer and Benefit&#8217;s Porefessional. They seem to be similar in quality but I can&#8217;t make a right assessment since I didn&#8217;t wear them as often.</p>
