<p>My Sephora Gift Card Giveaway just ended! When I began this blog, I wanted to host a giveaway to get my blog noticed and to give back to those who have supported me in this journey. I scoured the internet to find the best way to host a giveaway. I didn&#8217;t know much going into it other than:</p>
<h4>1. I didn&#8217;t want to pay to host a giveaway on my site.</h4>
<h4>2. It needed to be super simple.</h4>
<p>Dustin, my techy husband looked too. After a few days I decided to try <a href="https://www.rafflecopter.com?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Rafflecopter</a>. This company has a free giveaway option. Of course there&#8217;s an up sell, ( I didn&#8217;t use these options, but you can check out their site for more information) but overall it was super helpful for a new blogger like myself.</p>
<p>To begin, Rafflecopter is free but you have to sign up. Once you sign up you can host as many giveaways as you&#8217;d like. According to the website, Rafflecopter began in 2011 as a free application and later added extras. Here are the basic steps I went through for my giveaway:</p>
<h2>1. Signed up for Rafflecopter</h2>
<p>This is a super easy step. You basically <a href="https://www.rafflecopter.com/?home&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">sign up</a> by giving them your email and then you&#8217;re given a dashboard where you can keep track of your giveaways. There isn&#8217;t an upfront fee or anything. It&#8217;s free.</p>
<h2>2. Purchased a $50 Gift Card from Sephora</h2>
<p>You need to decide what you want to giveaway. I chose to giveaway a Sephora gift card since my blog is primarily about makeup and beauty. I went ahead and purchased it before beginning the giveaway. This is a pretty simple step. <strong>Think about what a large audience would be interested in.</strong> Don&#8217;t pick something too specific. Gift cards work well because people can buy whatever they want with them. Also make sure there are many stores throughout the United States. My gift card also comes with a complimentary makeover at <a href="http://www.sephora.com/?om_mmc=ppc-GG&amp;mkwid=sAUTwFNBV&amp;pcrid=56327149457&amp;pdv=c&amp;site=us_search&amp;country_switch=us&amp;lang=en&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjw7_mrBRDH4Y2UjLHEmfcBEiQA8OTHf0TiXO9p4sJxgkrGzIqihoMGGr1VtoGDLnc4d5ZfG0EaAiVv8P8HAQ&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Sephora </a>and a little mirror for your purse.</p>
<h2>3. Decided What I Wanted Wy Entries to Be</h2>
<p>I personally think this was the most difficult part. Rafflecopter allows you to pick how people can enter your giveaway. Some of the options are only available for those who have more advanced subscriptions. I picked only the free options. Some of them included following my blog on Twitter, tweeting a message, commenting on a blog post, sharing a blog post on Facebook, following me on Instagram, and liking my blog&#8217;s Facebook page. You can create custom entries too and then assign them a number. For instance, just tweeting a tweet was only 3 entires while commenting on a blog post was 5 entries. People will want to do all of the activities so that they will get more entries.</p>
<p>Rafflecopter allows you to make people &#8220;prove&#8221; that they did the steps. In this case, you can have them link to the Facebook post they shared or offer up their Instagram ID so you can make sure they follow you. I decided to begin building my email subscription and offered entries if you gave your email.</p>
<p>You can also chose if people could perform an entry multiple times. I allowed that if someone shared something once a day they could get more entires.</p>
<h2>4. Decided How Long the Giveaway Would Last</h2>
<p>Since this was my vert first giveaway and there were many different ways to enter, I decided to have the giveaway last a month. <strong>Looking back, I think I should&#8217;ve made it a little bit shorter.</strong> I got distracted and didn&#8217;t keep up with it as much as I should&#8217;ve. Of course this did give people more time to enter it. Rafflecopter lets you pick when it starts and when it ends.</p>
<h2>5. Posted It On My Blog</h2>
<p>As someone who doesn&#8217;t know a lot about coding, I was nervous about this part. I remembered a few friends had used Rafflecopter and the site promised it was super simple to post on your blog. Well, it was! All you do is copy the code and paste it anywhere in your blog text. To embed it, just go to the &#8220;text&#8221; version of your blog post instead of &#8220;visual&#8221; and paste it where you want it. Once I pasted it, the little giveaway box popped up where people could enter. Rafflecopter also lets you post it on a Facebook fan page.</p>
<h2>6. Tried to Keep Up with Promotion</h2>
<p>This was the hardest part for me. I went on two vacations when the giveaway was being held and I didn&#8217;t write any new posts for my site. I noticed I got a lot of entries at the beginning, but near the end it began losing steam. The most entries I received were from Facebook. I&#8217;m pretty active on there and have a lot of friends and family. Along with Facebook I added it on Twitter and on Instagram. There was little interaction on those platforms. My husband also paid to have it promoted on a giveaway site. I&#8217;m not sure of the details of that but will write about it at a later time. He paid $5 I think of Fiverr.</p>
<h2>7. Emailed &amp; Announced the Winner</h2>
<p>Rafflecopter reminded me by email when it was a few weeks out and then before it ended. This helped me in posting it on Facebook and other places. At the very end I logged in and chose a random winner. The woman who won had followed me on Instagram and is from another state.Â It was easy because I emailed her through Rafflecopter and announced it on the plug-in as well. The next day she responded with her address and thanked me.</p>
<h2>8. Got A Spreadsheet with All the Entries</h2>
<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that Rafflecopter also gives you access to a spreadsheet with all the entires! This is such a great resource because I can see everyone who entered and all the information they provided for their entries. On the spreadsheet is also their collected email addresses (if they gave it to me for my email list). I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;m going to use all of this information, but I know it will be handy in the future as I develop the blog more. I had over 2,000 entries!</p>
<p>Here are my last running numbers:</p>
<p>-2,881 entries (Each person could earn about 31 entries)</p>
<p>-it ran a month</p>
<p>Once I review the other information I&#8217;ll have more numbers for you. Ex: How many individuals entered to win. How many people I personally knew entered.</p>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>I learned a lot! For $50, I was happy to give back to the blogging community and also get my blog out there. Here are my main takeaways:</p>
<p>-go with a gift card, not something too specific</p>
<p>-choose a dollar amount that&#8217;s worth someone&#8217;s time</p>
<p>-don&#8217;t pay money to host a giveaway if you&#8217;re beginning</p>
<p>-promote the giveaway daily on social media</p>
<p>-consider buying advertisement on Fiverr</p>
<p>-have fun!</p>
<p>Have any other suggestions or questions? Feel free to add your thoughts below!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

If you&#8217;re checking this post out, chances are you&#8217;ve already seen some of my blog and want to know a little bit more about me and what I&#8217;m about. (Or where I began)</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;ve become a world-wide-web phenomenon and I&#8217;m working with Sephora and Taylor Swift is my bestie and calls me when her cats aren&#8217;t getting along.</p>
<p>Or&#8230; you may have just stumbled upon this itty bitty section of the internet by accident or by looking up information about T-swift&#8217;s <a href="http://www.etonline.com/news/2014/12/24121965/set_taylor_swift_coca_cola_640.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">cats</a>.</p>
<p>However you got here: I hope we can become fast friends and you&#8217;ll want to click around and stay awhile.</p>
<p><strong>Poeticlaughter is a blog dedicated to life and beauty through the lens of love.</strong></p>
<p>The journey to begin this blog is a long one with many attempts and failures. I remember when I lived in Chicago (in 2010) and worked in an office. I hated it. I lacked creativity and was sick of getting everyone&#8217;s mail everyday. Deep inside I knew I had <strong>more to offer the world</strong> and that I just needed the <strong>right push.Â </strong></p>
<p>A few years went by and we moved to Ohio. I began freelance writing and learned to have the confidence I needed to run an online business and express myself as a writer. Many different beauty blogs approached me and I wrote a lot about interior design, beauty, and travel. As I wrote, I realized I wanted to create <strong>something organic</strong>&#8230;something new that I wasn&#8217;t being monitored to write. It was through reading lots of different books about online business and flipping through many magazines that I realized:</p>
<p><strong>I have something unique to offer.</strong> There aren&#8217;t many beauty and lifestyle blogs that follow the latest trends but with an uplifting, empowering believersÂ perspective.</p>
<p>So what does Poeticlaughter mean? It means that there is beauty and poetry in our life and laughter. It means that you can laugh at yourself and embrace your unique God-given talents in a way that doesn&#8217;t make others feel less-than. It means that whether you&#8217;re in your teens or are navigating retirement you can be beautiful inside and out while<strong> leaving your own mark on the world.Â </strong></p>
<p>On poeticlaughter.com I&#8217;ll be your guide, blogging about the latest in makeup, home decor, relationships and life! Although my primary focus will be on <strong>beauty</strong>, you may see glimpses of my personal life. I&#8217;m learning to love myself Â well and the world around me one day at a time. Join me and learn a thing or two about lipstick, the latest in skincare, and if that hyped-upÂ mascara is really worth $24.</p>
<p>Oh, and there may be a few posts about cats.</p>
