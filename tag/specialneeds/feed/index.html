<p>We began overnight continuous feeds recently and it&#8217;s been such a game changer! Isabella has trouble gaining weight and was once slapped with the terrible diagnosis of &#8220;failure to thrive.&#8221; There are many reasons why she can&#8217;t eat by mouth, but for this post I&#8217;ll focus in on what an overnight continuous feed looks like for us. </p>

<p>I absolutely love the cute Honest Company diapers with the apples. We haven&#8217;t been able to share the wonder and beauty of Fall with Bella outside, but have decorated and used fun Fall things around the house&#8230;like these diapers.</p>



<h2>Getting Bella Ready For Bed </h2>



<p>Before bed, we put Bella in her pajamas and hook her up to her extension set. (I read it was best to attach the tubing to her diaper. I&#8217;ve gone away from that because we change her diaper throughout the night.) What you see here is her Mini One Feeding Tube attached to her extension set. We then give meds and her feed through the extension. The extension is good for an entire week. The feeding bag, which is filled with formula and attaches to the pump, is only good for 24hrs. (Yes, we throw away a pump bag and tubing every single day. It&#8217;s a crazy amount of waste). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-2395" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1174w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1174px) 100vw, 1174px" />
<figcaption>Trying overnight feeds the first time</figcaption>
</figure>



<h2>The First Night</h2>



<p>For the first night I had Bella sleep right next to me. I was very nervous about her strangling herself, pulling her button out, or vomiting and choking/aspirating. Here you can see Bella is hooked up to the pump tubing, IV pole, and extension set. It went amazingly. She didn&#8217;t even vomit! I woke up a lot of check on her but she seemed so happy and content. When I woke up I realized I had gotten SO MUCH SLEEP and so had she. It was crazy. I&#8217;m used to only getting 5 hours, interrupted. To switch to 8 hours was a massive blessing.</p>



<h2>Why Do Overnight Feeds Help Isabella?</h2>



<p>Overnight continuous feeds work well because Isabella has GERD (severe acid reflux) and a premature GI system. She is unable to take large volumes of formula at a time via feeding tube without throwing it up or being in pain. The goal of a continuous feed is to ensure she gets the nutrition she needs. The hope is that the very tiny amount of volume she gets per minute will be tolerated well and she will be less likely to vomit with less in her stomach. It also helps that she can rest uninterrupted. </p>



<p>Of course this is an added bonus to us! We have been on a &#8220;newborn&#8221; schedule until now (7 months) and her feeds were taking us a minimum of an hour and a half. We would need to hold her upright for an hour during the feed and then another 30 minutes to help prevent vomiting. Even then she would throw up quite a lot. To be completely honest we would bring ice packs to bed with us while feeding her to stay awake. We would blare our TV and talk to each other or watch movies. We couldn&#8217;t fall asleep during her feeds and it was very exhausting. At the time when her vomiting was at its worst we were feeding her 8x a day. To do the feed, hold her, prep the pump, etc, it was 2 hours each time. We literally spent 16 hours a day feeding Bella. </p>

</figure>



<h2>Setting Bella&#8217;s Pump, How Does It Work?</h2>



<p>The pump can be set for different rates and amounts of volume for her to receive. For Bella, we give her 30ml of a specific formula custom for her every hour. That&#8217;s 1/2 an ounce an hour. Or, 1/2ml per minute. It&#8217;s basically like an IV drip, only with formula. We allow this to run from 10pm until 9am. The formula is good to be hung for 4 hours. We wake up 2x to refill the pump bag with fresh formula mixed up and prepped in the fridge. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-2433" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1409.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1409.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1409-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1409-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" />

</figure>



<h2>Why Do You Wake Up?</h2>



<p>We wake up at 2am and 6am. At this time we rewarm a bottle and add the liquid to the pump bag. We also check on Bella&#8217;s tubing, change her diaper, and check for leaking. At 2am I also give her a medication that I push through her tubing with a syringe. At 9am (or later if she&#8217;s still sleeping and we can squeeze a bit extra formula in) her alarm on her pump will sound and I will turn it off. The alarm sounds if the bag is empty, but we set our own alarms. We certainly don&#8217;t want to forget to refill the bag or else the pump will pump air into her belly! That can be very painful for a little one. Above you can see that her Gtube sometimes leaks. We have to change her outfit and sheets when this happens. </p>

<h2>Does She Still Eat During The Day?</h2>



<p>Yes! Bella still gets fed 3x during the day. We give her 75ml over an hour at 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm. She gets a little over 1ml an hour. She tolerates it rather well and usually just naps during the 12pm and 4pm feed on my chest. I still have to hold her upright for an hour and a half. Then, at the 8pm feed she falls asleep and stays asleep for the rest of the night. Of course we accidentally wake her to take her to bed and &#8220;hook her up&#8221; but she usually just groggily smiles and then falls back asleep.</p>

<figcaption>Mommy and Me Time!</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>I love feeding Bella. It&#8217;s a very special time. She snuggles up and I have an hour and a half to just be cozy with her. In the beginning I had to do this A LOT (8x a day shared with Dustin). That made it hard to do anything, including making insurance calls and eat. Now it&#8217;s only 2x a day and Dustin does 1. This 3 hours is helpful to slow down and rest. Above is my setup for Bella&#8217;s feeds. I&#8217;m tethered to her and her pump so I make sure to empty my bladder, get anything I want nearby and get comfy! I just finished a fun book called Girl Wash Your Face. </p>

<h2>Overnight Feeding Has It&#8217;s Challenges</h2>



<p>So, sleeping almost all night and not waking up every few hours is amazing. It&#8217;s so crazy awesome. BUT, there are some challenges with overnight feeds.</p>



<p>Bella moves around a lot and can pull on her button.</p>



<p>We alter her sleepers if they don&#8217;t have snaps by cutting a hole in them for the tubing. I run these down her leg to help keep her from tugging on the tubing or getting it caught around her neck. It&#8217;s actually pretty hard to find a ton of snap sleepers that are warm! So, we use zipper ones and just alter them ourselves. </p>



<p>We just recently began running the tubing through an empty paper towel roll to help keep it from away her head.</p>



<p>Sometimes if the button is pulled she leaks all over herself and the bed. We have to change out her clothing and the bedding. </p>



<p>The friction on her button causes her to break out. She can get skin breakdown near her stoma (stomach hole). So we have to keep bandages on it and rash cream to keep it from bleeding. </p>



<p>Sometimes I worry about her silently aspirating the formula into her lungs. If she does it silently after vomiting, I have no way of knowing or stopping the pump if I&#8217;m asleep. I&#8217;ve had to simply give this fear to God and trust that Bella is big enough to turn her head and spit formula out. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-2434" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" />

</figure>



<h2>Overall, It&#8217;s the Right Choice For Bella </h2>



<p>Continuous overnight feeds has certainly helped Bella so much. She still vomits at least once during the night or morning, but it&#8217;s not a lot of formula! Sometimes she&#8217;ll go all night not vomiting and will simply wake up throwing up a small volume! I don&#8217;t even have to change her bedding. For us, this is awesome. She was throwing up 5+ times a night before and not gaining the weight she desperately needed. Now, she seems to be hitting new milestones and seems to rested. We&#8217;ve put off continuous feeds during the day, to keep her from being hooked up all the time, and hope we can keep avoiding it by doing this. We can also avoid certain medications to empty her stomach quicker and a GJ tube which puts formula into her small intestine! </p>

<p>Also, note, our bed is made! Thanks to the extra sleep I was getting. I can&#8217;t remember when I took the above pictures, but you better believe the bed is made now almost every day thanks to the restful night and clean bedding with no throw up! </p>

<p>It&#8217;s so hard to find the time to write&#8230;but I make it happen.</p>
<p>Tonight it&#8217;s either a bubble bath or writing a quick update&#8230;and I think an update is overdue, especially with the new feeding schedule we&#8217;ve acquired.</p>

<p>Isabella is doing very well! We have been doing continuous feeds overnight for about a week now. She is sleeping through the night and seems to be growing so much better. She doesn&#8217;t vomit at night as much and seems to be able to sleep peacefully while being fed. That&#8217;s crazy!</p>
<h2>Below are a few &#8220;real&#8221; posts about Isabella&#8217;s struggle</h2>
<p>This is what a life looks like with Bella. It&#8217;s so hard to see her in pain, but we are so glad she is improving. I wanted to share some &#8220;realness&#8221; with you to get a small glimpse into our daily struggle.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2391" style="width: 527px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1014.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class=" wp-image-2391" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1014.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="527" height="703" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1014.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1014-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1014-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Vomiting with dad</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Although her tummy still gets upset and she does vomit, it&#8217;s not as much. Bella moves more and thus has a pretty good aim for mommy/daddy&#8217;s face. Here Bella projected all over the couch and Dustin&#8217;s mouth! Ew!</p>
<p>She&#8217;s in pain a lot from her feeds. Here, below I captured her hurting. We can&#8217;t not feed her, so we have to pause and restart her pump until she can handle it.</p>

<p>Above is the amount of laundry we have after just one trip to Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital. There are usually at least 5 burp cloths, a change of clothes for me and her, and blankets.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2389" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0774.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-2389" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0774.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="660" height="880" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0774.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0774-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0774-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">bedding</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 17px;">Every night we change Bella&#8217;s bedding (before continuous feeds) sometimes up to 5x a night. Currently we only change it once! Above you can see we are changing out her clothes, burp cloth, and bedding. </span></p>

<p><figure id="attachment_2388" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0689.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-2388" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0689.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="660" height="880" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0689.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0689-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0689-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Daddy catches vomit</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly not glamorous, but we do our best to keep a positive outlook. We use a ton of baby wipes and burp clothes. Bella&#8217;s still too tiny to give a bath every time she vomits or else she&#8217;d be burning a lot of calories she desperately needs to grow.</p>
<h2>The Current Diagnosis</h2>
<p><figure id="attachment_2399" style="width: 615px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1284.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class=" wp-image-2399" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1284-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="615" height="461" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1284-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1284-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1284-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1284-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1284.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Getting ready to eat while sleeping</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Currently the Gastroenterologists have agreed that Bella has severe GERD/reflux and a premature GI system. We did many tests to explore her vomiting further and nothing critical came to light. At this point, we will settle with the diagnosis. Of course she&#8217;s not gaining as well as she should, but she is gaining! We will celebrate this!</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2401" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1318.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-large wp-image-2401" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1318-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1318-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1318-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1318-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1318-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1318.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">she moves so much in her sleep!</figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>The Tests</h2>
<p>We did the following tests to rule out anything underlying. Full blood work, Upper GI, Gastric Emptying Test, PH Probe, Barium Enema, and multiple Xrays. Her care team and I agree that there&#8217;s no need currently to do further testing, such as a scope.</p>
<h2>The Solution(s)</h2>
<p><figure id="attachment_2396" style="width: 409px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1230.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class=" wp-image-2396" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1230.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="409" height="546" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1230.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1230-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1230-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">her pump at night</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Our current solution to her vomiting and not gaining as well as she should is the following:</p>
<h4>Her Special Diet:</h4>
<p><figure id="attachment_2393" style="width: 525px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1152.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class=" wp-image-2393" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1152.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="525" height="700" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1152.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1152-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1152-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Elecare</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Her formula is fortified to be 30 calories per ounce. We use Elecare which is hypoallergenic and easy to digest. We also add Polycal which adds calories. During the day we mix in Beechnut Rice Cereal.</p>
<h4>Continuous Feeds/Bolus Feeds</h4>
<p><figure id="attachment_2398" style="width: 501px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1283.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class=" wp-image-2398" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1283-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="501" height="376" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1283-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1283-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1283-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1283-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1283.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">continuous feeds</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>We now do continuous overnight feeds. That means Bella gets fed from 10pm until 9am. I&#8217;ll have to write much more on this. This is a great solution because she can handle a small amount of formula while laying down. This also ensures she&#8217;s getting nutrition without throwing it up. She receives 330ml and gets 30ml over an hour. We wake up to refill the bag and also to change her diaper twice. She can usually sleep through it&#8230;or wakes up, smiles, and goes back to sleep. She usually vomits once per night.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2397" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1269.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class=" wp-image-2397" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1269.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="500" height="667" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1269.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1269-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1269-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">bella before night feed</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Bolus feeds, or one time larger feeds, are given three times during the day. They happen at 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm. We give her 75ml over an hour. Sadly, she is throwing up quite a bit during the day still, but we know the continuous feed overnight helps make sure she&#8217;s not losing too much.</p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p><figure id="attachment_2386" style="width: 423px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0387.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class=" wp-image-2386" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0387.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="423" height="564" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0387.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0387-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0387-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">giving meds</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Isabella is on medications to help manage her GI issues. She takes both Omeprazole (commonly recognized as Nexium/Prilosec/Etc.) and Famotidine (otherwise known as Pepcid). Both of these work together to help her stomach acid and relieve her stomach upset. Omeprazole blocks the acid production of the stomach and Famotidine, which as I understand it, decreases the amount of acid.</p>
<h4>Upright</h4>
<p><figure id="attachment_2403" style="width: 447px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9842.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class=" wp-image-2403" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9842.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="447" height="596" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9842.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9842-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9842-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">holding bella upright</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Bella throws up when she&#8217;s moved after a feed. To combat this, we hold her upright for at least 30 minutes after her daytime feeds. If we sit her down too soon, she usually vomits. This makes each feed at least an hour and a half. One hour for the pump and 30 minutes to hold. I don&#8217;t mind cuddles at this point, but she&#8217;s getting bigger and wanting to move around more!</p>
<p>Many of you asked about her esophagus muscles. We asked as well. We know they are premature and not developed well. This means that she&#8217;s unable to protect her airway or keep food down. We know this from a swallow study we did in the NICU. That being said, the specialists have explained that this will improve in time and there&#8217;s no need for surgery.</p>

<p>Thanks to some amazing friends, (Thank you Mr/Mrs. Hower!) we now have a sit-me-up-seat that can help her eat while playing. I&#8217;ve been working with her to get used to it and so far she loves sitting in it. Hopefully soon she can eat while in it and not fall asleep!</p>
<h2>Other Options</h2>
<p>Other solutions are still on the table for Isabella. We can switch to continuous feeds all day and all night, utilize medications that help her stomach empty faster, or have a GJ tube inserted in place of her current Gtube. For now, we are going to continue with the overnight feeds and pray we can avoid other options. Of course we are willing to explore them if needed.</p>

<h2>Thank You &amp; Not Being Able To Respond Sometimes</h2>
<p>Thank you again for all of your love and support. I&#8217;m so sorry I&#8217;m not able to fully respond to all comments. I try to but sometimes I&#8217;m just so busy! I read each one and am so moved by all of your continued support and love for Bella. I am so excited that as she gets bigger she can meet many of you!</p>
<p>Love Love,</p>
<p>Tiff</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Saturday and Dustin is feeding Bella. I snuck away to write a few quick words on here!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so so happy to share these amazing family photographs with you. As I mentioned in my <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/27-weeker-micropreemie-photoshoot/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">blog post before</a>, having photos done in the NICU was amazing and special&#8230;but I dreamed of family photos outside of the hospital walls! Oh&#8230;and having Bella unhooked from all the wires!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll note that in these pictures she&#8217;s about 6 months old. The ones from the NICU were taken when she was 14 days old.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2300" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-300x200.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-768x511.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-640x426.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Teresa Young of Teresa Young Photography made this dream a reality and came to our home to take photographs of us in our backyard. She was so incredibly flexible. In fact, the day we had scheduled for her to take our photos, <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/im-getting-tired-of-the-er-when-bellas-gtube-falls-out-pt1/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Bella&#8217;s feeding tube fell out</a> and we had to head to Akron, an hour and a half away. We had to cancel!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2316" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-681x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="681" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-681x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 681w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-200x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 200w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-768x1154.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-640x962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /></a></p>
<p>So we rescheduled. She came over and was so kind and amazing. She even went for hand sanitizer before I awkwardly needed to ask! (Loving acts that speak to a preemie momma&#8217;s soul!) It was so nice to have her meet Bella, since I don&#8217;t get to share her with many people. We waited until the last minute to put our coordinated outfits on for fear of Bella vomiting on all of them. This was a great decision since she did in fact throw up all over herself and Dustin right before Teresa walked in the door!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery19.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2323" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery19-682x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="682" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery19-682x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 682w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery19-200x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 200w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery19-768x1154.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery19-640x962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a></p>
<p>I stressed so much about everything looking &#8220;perfect.&#8221; In the end I was just thankful that we were alive. And here. And able to take photos. I even considered paying someone to paint our fence (it only got one coat last season)&#8230;but that was silly and Teresa assured me she could make the photos look nice in our less-than-perfect backyard. She was right!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2320" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-682x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="682" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-682x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 682w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-200x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 200w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-768x1154.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-640x962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a></p>
<p>Bella was nervous. She really hasn&#8217;t been outside much and it was her very first time on a blanket in the grass! It was very humid and I was sweating buckets. My makeup was sweating off! BUT&#8230;Teresa did such a great job that when I see these&#8230;my eyes don&#8217;t immediately go to the imperfections&#8230;but to the joy we all have. Even though Bella wouldn&#8217;t give us a smile&#8230;she looks healthy and relaxed. She also looks very inquisitive.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2308" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4-300x200.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4-768x511.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4-640x426.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest&#8230;my thoughts did go to her birthmark. (The large red bump on her scalp) I can be a little insecure about it still from time to time. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/whats-on-her-head-a-hemangioma-story/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">We&#8217;re treating it because it was harming her,</a> but we probably would treat it regardless at this point for cosmetic reasons. I&#8217;m all for loving yourself as God made you&#8230;but this in particular can give her issues down the road and is a quick and mild fix. That all being said, I love it because it&#8217;s a part of her and what makes her, her. I&#8217;ve grown to accept it as who God&#8217;s made her&#8230;but know that if there&#8217;s a solution that will improve her quality of life&#8230;I&#8217;m going to take it. Especially if it&#8217;s not harming her. My eye does go to the red bump&#8230;as I&#8217;m sure other&#8217;s do, but I&#8217;m not sad about it anymore.</p>
<p>As my Grandma said &#8220;If that&#8217;s the only thing she&#8217;s taking out of the NICU with her&#8230;we can rejoice&#8221; Or as Dustin says lovingly &#8220;She&#8217;s so beautiful&#8230;maybe God put it there to keep her humble.&#8221; haha</p>

<p>These photos are what I dreamed of. They&#8217;re as &#8220;Pinterest Perfect&#8221; as they come&#8230;but not because they were from a perfect situation. They&#8217;re perfect because they represent a warrior in this little one. A dedicated village. A sense of determination and grit and heart. The represent the heart of our God. That he loves us and wants us to grow in Him.</p>

<p>So excuse me while I go cry in a corner with a handful of Hershey Kisses while reflecting on the simplicity and beauty that Teresa captured.  Here&#8217;s a post on Facebook that I made as soon as I saw the photographs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before Bella was born&#8230;before I was pregnant with her&#8230;before our miscarriage last year&#8230;I filled Pinterest boards with newborn photography. I dreamed of our little family&#8230;perfected behind a creative lens. I virtually &#8220;shopped&#8221; for outfits and themes.</p>
<p>After we lost our first pregnancy I deleted those boards&#8230;there wouldn&#8217;t be any newborn pictures.</p>
<p>But then we found out months later we were expecting Isabella. My faith in God gave me the courage to embrace hope. Hope t<span class="text_exposed_show">hat this little soul would be in family photos. Once again I filled inspiration boards&#8230;as the months went by they became tailored to a little baby girl <span class="_5mfr _47e3"><img class="img" role="presentation" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/f3/1/16/1f380.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="16" height="16" /><span class="_7oe">?</span></span></span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>As much as we can plan, God directs our lives. I hadn&#8217;t dreamt that Bella would be born 3 months early and we would spend 110 days in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. I never imagined it&#8217;d take 60 days for my own mother to touch her&#8230;or almost 6 months for these precious precious family photographs.</p>
<p>While in the hospital a photographer took pictures of us when Bella was only 14 days old. Not yet 2lbs&#8230;these photos are now so special&#8230;even with her wires, no clothing, and cpap on. Yet&#8230;I still dreamed and hoped for pictures of our sweet girl free of hospital walls.</p>
<p>The road to these photographs is marked with loss, heart break, confusion, joy, peace, fear, and more. The truth that we are even physically here in these pictures does not fall short on us. We miss our first little one terribly, but are so thankful Bella and I are here. Tears run down my cheeks as I realize my dream of family photos has been honored by our amazing God.</p>
<p>And then, to add that the amazingly talented young women and friend who captured these has children of her own..and one who has/is facing medical challenges&#8230;blows me away. Teresa Young was so gracious and flexible. We had to cancel on her because Bella&#8217;s gtube fell out. We didn&#8217;t have our fence painted or even our own blanket to pose on&#8230;but she came to our home and captured these for us&#8230;at no charge. She used hand sanitizer without me prompting and understood how fragile Bella was and how she was one of the very first non-family members to meet her. I was sweating buckets and Bella was nervous being near grass for the first time&#8230;but it worked. These pictures are so anticipated and treasured. The power of God working through Teresa is incredible. Please, consider getting family photos done. Things don&#8217;t have to be perfect. You don&#8217;t have to be your goal weight or have everything figured out. I was terrified Bella would vomit all over. I was worried her birthmark would look weird. (She didn&#8217;t and it doesn&#8217;t). Whatever is holding you back, don&#8217;t let it. You won&#8217;t regret it. Consider Teresa Young. She&#8217;s amazing. Thank you for creating something priceless for me. And sending them at the perfect time&#8230;when there&#8217;s fear and uncertainty and nervousness in my heart for my sweet girl.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just be over here crying&#8230;and thinking up ways to display this dream realized in our home.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the greatest gifts we&#8217;ve received are professional photographs taken in the NICU. These were taken while Bella was only 14 days old. I remember signing up so excitedly on the paper sign up sheet in the family lounge and then crying when I realized she would have her cpap (breathing help/mask thing) on. I walked back up and began crossing our names off the list. But Dustin looked at me and said &#8220;Tiffany, we want these pictures. We have nothing to be embarrassed about. This is her right now. This is her journey.&#8221; It&#8217;s true! I&#8217;m so glad we didn&#8217;t wait until she looked &#8220;ideal&#8221; to take these photos. This was us. This was her. This was our reality.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2204" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179-1024x819.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="819" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179-1024x819.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179-300x240.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179-768x614.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179-640x512.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>But of course I struggled when I looked down at her and the photographer walked into the room. I even asked the nurses if we could sneak the cpap off for a few photos. (So silly of me). I was still very much overwhelmed and in a lot of pain from my emergency c-section. I was also pumping like crazy, living in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, taking pain killers, taking blood pressure medication, and trying to be a mom. It was one of the hardest times of my life yet it was filled with so much peace and joy. I believe that this is reflected in these photos.</p>

<p>To be honest, I almost didn&#8217;t want anyone to see these. Bella looks&#8230;scary. Kind of like an animal. She doesn&#8217;t really look like the cuddly baby you imagine or see in pictures. BUT we loved her all the same and I held onto hope that she would grow and develop into a beautiful little one&#8230;and God didn&#8217;t put that hope to shame!</p>

<p>Looking back, I carefully curated things I shared with the world. Dustin and I always wanted the way we presented our story to be a story of hope and love. We wanted Bella to be able to look back and be proud of how we shared her journey. I believe we have been good stewards of this. Some questioned early on&#8230;including us&#8230;if we should share so transparently about our journey. I know it&#8217;s not for everyone&#8230;and not everyone is called to it&#8230;but we felt we were called by the Lord to share Isabella with everyone in a public way.</p>

<p>From the day years ago that God told me I&#8217;d have a daughter and to name her Isabella Melody we&#8217;ve known she would be used greatly in His Kingdom.</p>

<p>So, I share these photographs to inspire others and give them a HOPE. You probably are looking up viability of a 27 weeker or maybe you are in the NICU and hope your baby will look a bit different as the month go on. (They will).</p>

<p>Isabella was born at 27 weeks but only weighed 1 lb 7 ounces due to restricted growth. I had an emergency cesarean that I was put under for since I had severe preeclampsia and stage 2 HELLP Syndrome that threatened my life.</p>

<p>If you notice the shock and awe of this image&#8230;it&#8217;s because this was the very first time I held Bella cradled in my arms and without doing skin to skin! For 14 days I had only held her chest to chest and while doing kangaroo care (skin to skin).</p>

<p>As the days passed her coloring got better, she grew, and medical devices and medications were slowly taken away. Now, she is 6 months old and doing great. She has a feeding tube due to silent aspiration but other than that she is a healthy, happy baby.</p>

<p>If you look closely you can see the strange white hair that covered her entire little body. This is called lanugo and went away after awhile. She was very fragile at this time to we used help getting her out of the isolette and she wasn&#8217;t moved around too much.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have to post more about this information, but she doesn&#8217;t have clothing on because she was in a controlled warm isolette and she needed to be seen by nurses/doctors. As she grew she could wear clothing&#8230;around 1 month or so.</p>
<p>I want to thank Simon Says Smile for this amazing gift to us. This is a volunteer program offered through <a href="http://www.blackdogphotoco.com/index.html/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Black Dog Photo Co.</a> They came and did this photo shoot free of charge. (AND later helped us when we accidentally overrode these pictures). AMAZING people.</p>
<p>Lastly, we had another amazing photo shoot done by Teresa Young. She also gifted these amazing photos to us. This was a very emotional moment as I had dreamed of some &#8220;normal&#8221; looking images of my tribe. Here&#8217;s a little teaser and I&#8217;ll post the rest another time.</p>

<p>Curious about her birthmark on her scalp? It&#8217;s called a hemangioma. It&#8217;s a superficial birth mark. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/whats-on-her-head-a-hemangioma-story/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Learn more from this post.</a></p>

<p>This little princess is wise beyond her years. 6 months, about 9 1/2lbs in this image. Adjusted age is 3 months.</p>

<p>It seems like just yesterday that we left the NICU at <a href="https://www.akronchildrens.org/For-Families-Patients.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital</a>. I have very many mixed memories of that place. Some of the scariest times of my life happened behind those walls and some of the happiest.</p>
<p>In the midst of a dark time we did our best to make the NICU home. Years ago I bought an art print that says, &#8220;Home is wherever I&#8217;m with you.&#8221; (Yes, it was bought from Urban Outfitters and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHEOF_rcND8&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros</a> were popular&#8230;ok now listening to them on repeat).</p>
<p>Since our marriage, Dustin and I have moved six times. It&#8217;s funny to add &#8220;NICU&#8221; to that list. We spent most nights there but spent 17 at <a href="http://rmhakron.org/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Ronald McDonald House</a> and once a week at home to rest up. I plan on writing a lot more about making the NICU home and our experiences there. In the meantime, enjoy this video I took near the end of our stay. You can tell Bella is much more stable and is even in an open cot!</p>
<p>XOXO</p>
<p>Tiff</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>(Of course I&#8217;m just posting this. So, the date this was written was a bit ago and the dates we were in the ER were August 2nd and July 26th)</p>
<p>Thankfully, we were not in the ER today. But, we spent time there twice within the last two weeks, one week apart exactly. Why? You ask? Because Isabellas <a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/g-tube.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Gtube</a> keeps falling out!</p>
<p>For me, blogging has been very therapeutic and helps me get my thoughts organized. Having a daughter with numerous health issues is overwhelming. One of the things I found when we lived in the NICU is that there are lots of resources about preemies but not many about G tube&#8217;s. So, I decided to begin blogging about her G-tube journey so that other moms might find it useful. This is also a great way to keep family and friends updated.</p>
<h2>The Dreaded Day Bella&#8217;s Feeding Tube Fell Out</h2>
<p>Bella has a G-tube and we were trained on it in the NICU. I felt pretty confident about things except for replacing the button at home. I knew it would just take some getting used to. But I&#8217;m quite squeamish and looking into a hole in your baby&#8217;s stomach can certainly freak you out. We&#8217;ve become quite comfortable with this little button. We do hook up to feeds eight times a day. So, when her feeding tube did fall out we were prepared.</p>
<p>It was during her for 4:30pm feed. I noticed Isabellas button looked loose. We were going to vent her which basically means let air out of her belly. She was crying and the button was being pushed out. This is pretty normal so I didn&#8217;t think much of it. When she cries the pressure in her stomach can push the button out. It&#8217;s not really something to be scared about. I mentioned it to Dustin who was with me. He didn&#8217;t think it was anything to worry about and continued hooking her extension to the button. I thought maybe I was being overdramatic and looked away for a second while he hooked her up. Before I knew it I heard him yelp and I looked down and the extension was attached to the button and the button was completely out of her stomach.</p>
<p>I looked down and saw the hole and immediately remembered what to do. Dustin ran and grabbed the emergency kit while I held pressure on the stoma (medical term for hole). Luckily Isabella hadn&#8217;t eaten for awhile so the stomach contents weren&#8217;t pouring out. She was unhappy but didn&#8217;t seem to be in pain. There was a little blood from her granulation tissue but nothing crazy.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2177" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9087.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2177 size-shareaholic-thumbnail" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9087-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9087-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9087-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9087.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bella sleeps on the way up to Akron. You can see the catheter hanging out on her side.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Dustin came in with the emergency kit in his hand. We prepare emergency kits with catheters in them in case the button falls out. It is a short-term fix to keep the hole open until we get to a surgeon who will replace it in the emergency department. Eventually we can switch out the button ourselves but since the hole is still healing, our surgeon instructed us to bring her to the emergency department at Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital. He told us the hole could close within 30 minutes and that it would be painful for them to reopen it. So there certainly is urgency in getting something in the hole to keep it open. There are only three people who are supposed to be able to change the button,  Dr Pittinger his partner, Dr. Andrews, or their surgical resident.</p>
<p>Dustin took the catheter and put a small amount of lube on the ends and inserted it into her hole then using a syringe we filled the end, which is like a balloon, with a measured amount of water to hold it in place. Once we made sure the amount of water was correctly in, I taped gauze around it and attached it to Isabellas shirt to keep it from pulling out.</p>
<p>Dustin ran downstairs to our office in the basement, (he works from home) and told his coworkers he would have to leave for the day. We are really lucky this happened near the end of the night so he didn&#8217;t have to miss a lot of work. We packed everything we needed to drive Akron Children&#8217;s Emergency Department which is an hour and a half away. I made sure we had formula, extra syringes, extra extensions, and all her medications.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2178" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9090.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2178 size-shareaholic-thumbnail" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9090-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9090-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9090-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9090.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Waiting for a short minute in the ER</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>We placed her in her carseat and used a button down to pull the extension out and lay it gently beside her. The ride to Akron was pretty uneventful and she actually slept away. She was getting hungry because she didn&#8217;t get her feed. She doesn&#8217;t take anything by mouth so if her G-tube is out we can&#8217;t give her food or her medications. We called family and I also contacted a friend who is bringing us dinner. We told her to still bring it and Dustin&#8217;s parents would pick it up and put it in the house for us. They were already planning on being over because they have been mowing our lawn for us!  On the way I called the Emergency Department and told them about Isabella and they contacted Dr Pittinger and his surgical resident. We explained Isabella was medically fragile and they said they would be ready for us when we arrived.</p>

<h2>Why&#8217;d It Fall Out?</h2>
<p>The feeding button fell out because the balloon holding it inside of Bella&#8217;s tummy deflated. This can happen if the button is old, punctured, or if the water is evaporating. To be honest we&#8217;re not sure why Bella&#8217;s button deflated completely. We asked the surgeon and they don&#8217;t know either. This was frustrating, but we were happy to know she had a new button in.</p>

<h2>Best Emergency Department Visit Ever</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s strange going back to Akron Children&#8217;s Emergency Department because we lived in the same building for over 100 days. The NICU is on the sixth and seventh floor. When we staying in Isabellas room up there, I remember countless hours staring out at the city and listening to the ambulances go in and out from the Emergency Department. We knew the area like the back of her hand. We walked into the Emergency Department and as soon as we said her name we were ushered back quickly into a room where they did an intake on Bella. Then they took us to a private room and the surgeon walked in with in six minutes. They ordered as a new button change kit,  even though we had our own (which saved time). It was nice that they moved so urgently.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2181" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9093.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2181 size-shareaholic-thumbnail" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9093-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9093-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9093-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9093.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Isabella lays on the hospital bed, waiting with the catheter in for her button to be replaced. You can see the red marks where the tape was pulled off. Here she has her catheter in.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>All the while, Bella was getting pretty hungry. The resident walked in, sterilized, gloved up, asked  a few questions and began assessing Bella. He asked if we wanted to put it back in, but we said no. I felt it was too far away from the official &#8220;heal&#8221; date of August 22nd. I also felt that if there was something wrong he would be able to tell. Within a few quick minutes he pulled the catheter out and inserted the new MiniOne button. Bella cried a bit when he accidentally tugged on the catheter, not realizing it was inflated inside her stomach (rolls eyes).</p>
<p>It was a quick quick thing. The button is inserted and then filled with water to keep it in place inside her stomach. You have to measure the water correctly so that you know how much is inflated inside of her. For Bella, her balloon takes 2.5mls. After awhile you memorize it and know to check it to make sure it has the right amount. Isabella doesn&#8217;t seem to be in pain during the change and was just annoyed someone was bugging her and hungry. As soon as we go the new button in, the surgeon made sure it the placement was correct by pushing fluid in and taking it out of the tubing.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2182" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9095.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2182 size-shareaholic-thumbnail" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9095-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9095-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9095-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9095.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Up close look at Bella&#8217;s stoma (medical term for hole). You can see the fluid and granulation tissue.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>We were able to stay in the private room to feed Bella. To feed her on the go, or in this case, an emergency, we put her speciality formula into a 60ml syringe and attach it to her extension cord. We then push the formula into her stomach slowly. She doesn&#8217;t tolerate this well and usually throws up. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t have time to fully pack the pump.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2184" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9097.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2184 size-shareaholic-thumbnail" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9097-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9097-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9097-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9097-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9097-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9097.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A quick fix!

<h2>They Know Us</h2>
<p>We were exhausted. We ran out of the house in a rush and were hitting the wall. We were so glad the ER visit took so little time and we were home before 9:00pm, but we were hungry. We walked in and saw a gift bag for us. Our friends Molly and Anthony Pingitore and their precious girls had prepared us dinner. We had a delicious chicken casserole, salad, cookie dough and green beans! While we prepared to feed Bella again we opened the sweetest card from them. Dustin and I both tried to hold back tears. It said lovely things and also had gifts for us. A gift card to Sephora for me and a gift card to Chipotle for Dustin.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2180" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9092.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2180 size-shareaholic-thumbnail" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9092-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9092-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9092-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9092.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bella sleeping after her button is changed.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>We fell into the couch after sanitizing and digged into a delicious meal. We both prayed out loud over Bella and our family. I know Molly and Anthony provided these things but I just felt the biggest hug from God himself. Not only did he provide the necessities (dinner), he provided chocolate chip cookie dough (we each grabbed some raw) AND a special gift for each of us. This was a very thoughtful gift since money&#8217;s rather tight and I don&#8217;t just go shopping for makeup. My foundation was running low and I wanted a new lipstick for my friends wedding. God used Molly to provide such a fun &#8220;extra&#8221; gift. That&#8217;s what I love about our Jesus. He cares about the little details that make us US. Thank you Molly and Anthony for allowing the Holy Spirit to work through you and for being so generous.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2185" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9100.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2185 size-shareaholic-thumbnail" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9100-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9100-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9100-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9100-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9100-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9100.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Special gifts from friends.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The rest of the week we also received some amazing meals and gifts from others too! God&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p>Anyway, as soon as we took a sigh of relief, and things felt &#8220;in control&#8221; a week later to the day her button fell out again and we did the trip/process all over again. This time, though, we got some good information and (spoiler) approval to change the button out at home from now on! See Part 2!</p>
<p>I love you all,</p>
<p>XOXO Tiff</p>

<p>Isabella was born without any birthmarks, but, after a few weeks we noticed a small, flat, red spot on her head. The NICU team assumed it was agitation from her CPAP hat so we switched her breathing assistance to give it a break from rubbing. After looking closely, her primary nurse and I determined it didn&#8217;t look like skin breakdown but more of a permanent spot. She threw out the thought, &#8220;oh she&#8217;s probably got a hemangioma!&#8221; I, of course was terrified looking up images (after learning to say/spell it).</p>
<p>My worst assumption ended up coming to fruition, Bella has a large hemangioma that looks every bit as scary as some of the ones I saw with my search. Simply put, it&#8217;s harmless, is considered a vascular birthmark, should go away as she grows, and is a collection of blood vessels. We did an MRI to rule out any issues and it&#8217;s completely superficial and cosmetic. Long story short, we choose not to treat it a few months ago. We got a second option from a pediatric dermatologist and heard from many neonatologists who treated Bella. We felt that was the right decision and that we would embrace it until things needed addressed. Until&#8230;</p>

<h2>Why is her birthmark a problem?</h2>
<p>Sadly, after being readmitted to the NICU we noticed 3 more teeny red dots/beginning of hemangiomas on her tummy/chest. They are elevating but don&#8217;t look scary yet. We were advised to follow up with dermatology to reconsider treatment. When there are 5, it&#8217;s recommended to begin treatment because there&#8217;s higher risk of internal ones. Internal ones can cause issues with major organs. The large one on her head is also growing rapidly. So, we were waiting for August 9th for her appointment when we noticed the birthmark changing color. I knew these things could ulcerate (skin breakdown), but hadn&#8217;t seen signs before. I&#8217;m so glad I trusted my intuition. I immediately contacted our dermatologist who confirmed with images it is beginning to ulcerate. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f641.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We began treating it with antibiotic cream and see him on Monday. (He offered the next day but we felt Bella needed to rest after going through so much). He said ulceration could be extremely painful. I&#8217;ve seen what they look like when they break down and it&#8217;s very painful looking.</p>

<p><figure id="attachment_2103" style="width: 379px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8828.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class=" wp-image-2103" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8828-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="379" height="284" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8828-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8828-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8828-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8828-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 379px) 100vw, 379px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Looking worse.</figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>What&#8217;s next? Isn&#8217;t it an easy fix?</h2>
<p>We will begin treatment with a drug called propranolol. This medication inhibits the growth of blood vessels and constricts current ones. This is hard for us as Bella is the size of a newborn (7lbs 12 ounces) and the thought of messing with her blood pressure/cardiovascular system terrifies us. That being said, with monitoring her blood pressure and vitals this treatment is safe and effective. It&#8217;s very commonly used. We don&#8217;t want the ulceration to get worse and we certainly don&#8217;t want to worry about internal hemangiomas!</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2120" style="width: 296px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8874-e1532047419102.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class=" wp-image-2120" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8874-e1532047419102-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="296" height="394" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8874-e1532047419102-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8874-e1532047419102-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8874-e1532047419102-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Looking super cute!</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I, personally would also like to prevent the others from getting to the size of her larger one. Since they&#8217;re on her chest/stomach they could interfere with her tummy time or gtube. After talking to the doctor, we decided to do a liver ultrasound just to confirm there aren&#8217;t any hemangiomas there. So, on Monday we&#8217;ll be trekking to Akron Children&#8217;s for her appointment and ultrasound.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2133" style="width: 430px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8891-e1532047564273.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class=" wp-image-2133" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8891-e1532047564273-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="430" height="573" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8891-e1532047564273-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8891-e1532047564273-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8891-e1532047564273-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Adorable enjoying her own nursery!</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Please pray</p>
<p>1.) This birthmark doesn&#8217;t ulcerate any further and that with treatment we can avoid pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>2.) Bella tolerates the medication.</p>
<p>3.) That we would be able to handle the magnitude of treating such a little one with such a serious prescription. That we would be extra careful with doses and track it well.</p>
<p>4.) Also, pray against any internal hemangiomas. We have no reason to believe she has any, but it is a possibility.</p>
<p>XOXO, Tiffany</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today was difficult. Since being home from the NICU we haven&#8217;t been so scared that Isabella would need to be sent back to Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital.</p>
<h2>The First Plan To Treat Reflux</h2>
<p>Lately she&#8217;s been spitting a lot after almost every feed and cries out in pain. We&#8217;ve known she has reflux, but were advised against treating it since she was doing OK and not spitting much&#8230;until more recently. After last week meeting with Speech Therapy and Nutrition, they noted she was hoarse and her esophagus could be getting burned so we should begin treating it. We got in the same day with our Pediatrician and began Zantac. We also ordered a pump for her gtube feeds, hoping that would help. Since then things have gotten worse. The Zantac made her struggle to go number two and seemed to increase the spitting. We stopped it and made an appointment for Friday.</p>
<h2>Where We&#8217;re At Today</h2>
<p>We didn&#8217;t know it would get to the point where she&#8217;s spitting up almost her entire feed and crying/screaming out in pain while being fed through her tube. She shows all the classic signs of reflux. The formula comes up through her nose, she burps it up, and she is coughing a lot. This afternoon I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to continue her feed because she was in agony. I&#8217;d stop it and restart it. She has to eat! She&#8217;s been labeled as Failure to Thrive once before so this is very scary for us. I called right away and got an appointment this afternoon. Sadly, she had only gained about one ounce since July 11th (6 days ago) and she&#8217;s supposed to be gaining an ounce per day. We strategized and decided to try Prilosec and Neosure Alimentum, a specific formula that may help. (In the NICU we tried this formula for a few days but saw no progress). Since we&#8217;ve been home tonight she&#8217;s only had a slight spit, slept through one feed with minimal crying, and cried through the other feed. It&#8217;s improvement. I&#8217;ll take it.</p>
<h2>Why Is She Getting Worse?</h2>
<p>We aren&#8217;t 100% sure why her reflux has taken such a dramatic turn but we have a few ideas. 1.) When she had her gtube surgery her stomach was moved. The Neonatologist had warned us this could cause reflux since the position of the stomach is different. 2.) Babies can &#8220;grow&#8221; into reflux. I&#8217;m not sure why, but it&#8217;s something that you see between 3-5 months we were told.</p>
<h2>Why Is This Such A Scary Thing?</h2>
<p>Isabella was a micropreemie and needs to grow. She is less than 1% in weight than the rest of those her age. Refusing to eat caused her to be readmitted into the NICU for another month. We later learned she silently aspirates (liquid goes into her lungs) when she eats. This has caused her to be extremely averted to bottles and most things orally. With her spitting up, we are concerned she could be aspirating that liquid. We have no way of knowing if it&#8217;s going into her lungs. Without keeping her formula down she could also lose weight, which is super scary for a baby already in the less than 1% for weight. This could lead her to be readmitted to the hospital.</p>
<p>Please pray that she stops spitting and begins tolerating feeds and isn&#8217;t in pain.</p>
<h2>When It Rains It Pours</h2>
<p>On top of the reflux, which was the most critical issue we were facing today, Isabella&#8217;s hemangioma (birthmark on her scalp) began to show signs of ulceration (skin breakdown). I had noticed a few dark spots and after some research learned that the large blood vessel filled mark could ulcerate and breakdown. It can also get infected. I sent off some images to our pediatric dermatologist and he called back, confirming it was beginning to ulcerate. We were given the option of taking her to Akron tomorrow but we felt it was best to wait a few days since she&#8217;d been through so much and we are beginning a new formula and medicine today.</p>
<p>He said that was OK and ordered a topical antibiotic to apply. We aren&#8217;t to use our fingers but a Qtip. Well, I kiss her all over her head and stoke her head and most certainly touch it, so I&#8217;ll need to be more careful and use more sanitizer.</p>
<p>We are also going to be treating the birthmark with medicine to make it shrink. 2 months ago we met with him and decided against treating it since it seemed as if it would go down and she only had one. It was only cosmetic and that was confirmed with an MRI. Now, she has 3 more and there&#8217;s concern for internal ones. So, for our next appointment we will begin a blood pressure medication to shrink it and the others. She will also have a liver ultrasound to rule out any internal ones.</p>
<p>My heart is super sad, but thankful we have access to medical professionals. Our dads both came over and brought goodies. Doug brought homemade pie, veggies from his garden, and chocolate zucchini bread. My dad ordered us Papa Johns, enough for tonight and tomorrow. They held Bella while I tried to get a grip on everything. Tomorrow we meet with Help Me Grow at home for her assessment for physical therapy and pediatric development. I&#8217;m praying it&#8217;s a better day and she&#8217;s not in pain.</p>
<p>Thank you all for following our journey and loving us well. Please pray tonight goes well.</p>
<p>XOXO Tiff</p>
