<p>This month there are so many exciting new makeup items I tried and loved! There are also a few things I&#8217;m digging that I don&#8217;t (quite) own (yet).</p>
<p><a href="http://crumpleandtoss.com/product/westside-kate-birthday/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Westside Kate Birthday Card, $6 from Crumple &amp; Toss</a></p>
<p>This cute birthday card is perfect for a stylish pal&#8217;s March birthday! I just discovered the online stationary/gift boutique Crumple &amp; Toss and love most everything they offer. The store also offers quirky products from <a href="http://crumpleandtoss.com/shop/ban-do/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Ban.do</a>, so you know it&#8217;s right up my alley. I&#8217;ve fallen for lots of new brands just by clicking around their site. This specific card is from <a href="https://sugarpaper.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Sugar Paper LA</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.katespade.com/cedar-street-dot-lacey/PWRU3913,en_US,pd.html?pid=PWRU3913&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Cedar Street Dot Lacey Wallet from Kate Spade,  $178</a></p>
<p>If I didn&#8217;t already own a beautifully chic wallet from <a href="http://www.betseyjohnson.com/?mkwid=s7REkXFJm&amp;pcrid=49592762877&amp;pdv=c&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwifWnBRCB5PT57KSVw-kBEiQASV7aRL7QwWnCivu4RWy3vVt59Defrb6nZSjU-xQGVn0zm4caAq2Z8P8HAQ&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Betsey Johnson</a> ($15-20 from TJMAXX), I may consider purchasing this polka dot wallet from Kate Spade. I&#8217;m not into designers too much, but man, I&#8217;d love to get my paws on a Kate Spade bag! This wallet has a classic look and has plenty of storage for all of my random $1 or less gift cards accumulating in my purse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sephora.com/la-base-pro-perfecting-makeup-primer-P219008?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">LA Base Pro Primer from Lancome, $42 </a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried a lot of different makeup primers but was swayed by the <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/lancome-makeup-haul/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">incredible gift</a> offered by Lancome in February if you spent $35 or more. I&#8217;ll be honest: this stuff works. I used it for my sister&#8217;s wedding and it kept my makeup from smearing off my face and revealing my constant struggle with adult acne! Instead, my sister and I looked flawless and our skin stayed looking matte. I&#8217;ll have to post pictures of the wedding so you can see for yourself! It&#8217;s a pricey beauty investment at $42 (that&#8217;s at least 10 caramel lattes)&#8230;but you only use a dime size every day and it keeps you from reapplying even pricier foundation.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already (and just why not?) check out <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/lancome-makeup-haul/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">my post</a> about this makeup primer from Lancome for even more deets.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shopbando.com/product/bando-it-girl-cuff?display=2335&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">It Girl Cuff in Party from Ban.do, $20</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just recently discovered this fantastically (This IS indeed a word. I looked it up) awesome brand called <a href="http://www.shopbando.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Ban.do</a>. Basically if you could sum up my style and quirky-chic lifestyle goals you could just photograph me laying in a pile of products from this company. The bright colors. The quirky sayings. The prints. The empowering message. Ohh ahh! I think it&#8217;s for the best I live at least 100 miles or more away from a place that carries their products. This still didn&#8217;t keep me from making an order for my upcoming photo shoot for the blog. I didn&#8217;t order this rose gold script bracelet but I might for another event. You can wear it along or layer it with other jewelry for a fun look.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sephora.com/roller-lash-P392516?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Roller Lash Mascara from Benefit Cosmetics, $24</a></p>
<p>The new mascara from Benefit came out in late February and I ordered it from Sephora! I&#8217;ve used it a number of times and love the way it curls my lashes. The jury is still out whether I like it more than They&#8217;re Real Mascara, but we shall see. Stay tuned for a <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/239/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">full review with pictures!</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lushusa.com/Celestial/9999900407,en_US,pd.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Celestial Moisturizer from LUSH, $24.95</a></p>
<p>The weather outside here in Ohio is still frightful and my skin is turning grayer and gloomier. A way I&#8217;ve been combating this is by applying moisturizer during the day when my skin is completely nekkid. I received a sample of <a href="http://www.lushusa.com/Gorgeous/02357,en_US,pd.html#start=6?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Gorgeous</a> moisturizer from Lush in a gift box a few years back. It changed my skin and I was dead-set on purchasing it&#8230;no matter the cost. Then I went into<a href="http://www.lushusa.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Lush-Site/en_US/Home-Show?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank"> Lush </a>and realized it was $89.95. Needless to say, I asked for a similar product that was more within my beauty budget. A few of the gals turned me onto Celestial after giving me a sample to try. I&#8217;ve been using it for about a year and have purchased it twice. In the summer, I don&#8217;t use it but in the winter it keeps my skin feeling super soft. It smells like sweet almond yogurt (if that&#8217;s a thing) and is made with Fresh Dove Orchid Extract which is supposed to do magic for your face. It&#8217;s made specifically for sensitive skin so that&#8217;s a plus.</p>
