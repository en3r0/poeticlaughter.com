<p>In preparation for the blog launch, I purchased a few items for the photo shoot. I couldn&#8217;t resist when <a href="http://www.baublebar.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">BaubleBar</a> sent me an email about their sample sale! I first heard of BaubleBar online. The bright colors and fun logo kept popping up on one of my sidebars. I assumed it was super pricey and just not something for me. Before I knew it, I was looking at their different products and contemplating some baubles for my sister&#8217;s wedding. (Maybe this brand was something I could afford!) BaubleBar has different discounts each week. There&#8217;s a weekly &#8220;buried bauble&#8221; that&#8217;s discounted. This jewelry item is usually $20. There are other sales for only $10. If you receive their emails, you get a hint as to where the buried bauble is hidden. After Christmas, I signed up for the company&#8217;s emails and saw some earrings for only $10 that would compliment my bridesmaid dress. I was shocked that the earrings included free shipping and free returns. <strong>Once it came in the mail I was sold.</strong> BaubleBar makes it feel like you&#8217;re receiving a special gift. Everything &#8211; from the product to the receipt are packaged professionally. After receiving and rocking the earrings, I ordered two more items for my blog branding shoot coming up.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-box-pink-logo.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74 size-large" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-box-pink-logo-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="baublebar-box-pink-logo" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-box-pink-logo.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-box-pink-logo-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-box-pink-logo-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-box-pink-logo-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>When you open the box, you can see the inside has a bright pink color and the company&#8217;s logo. Also note the fun striped tissue paper.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a sucker for pretty paper goods. Included in all orders is a neon envelope with your receipt. I thought the little &#8220;Yay!&#8221; envelope seal made the entire package!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-thankyou-card.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-83 size-large" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-thankyou-card-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="baublebar-thankyou-card" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-thankyou-card.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-thankyou-card-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-thankyou-card-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-thankyou-card-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>My card included a little catalogue introducing <a href="http://www.baublebar.com/guest-bartender/wendys-lookbook.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Wendy&#8217;s Lookbook</a> collaboration and a code for 20% off my next purchase.  BaubleBar works with all different women to showcase it&#8217;s jewelry. Wendy Nguyen is a famous blogger and fashion guru from <a href="http://www.wendyslookbook.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Wendy&#8217;s Lookbook.</a></p>

<p>Each item comes packaged in a drawstring cloth bag. This is perfect for storing your baubles after you wear them.</p>

<p>Why hello there! This necklace was something I was really looking forward to. For the BaubleBar sample sale the site had items that were up to 75% off. This necklace was $18. I think regularly it would probably be around $45-50. Even at $45, I&#8217;d probably purchase it for a special occasion or as a go-to statement necklace.</p>
<p>The design has turquoise plates which are cut out into different geometric shapes. These are attached to a thick (and shiny) gold chain. In total there are five different turquoise plates and three of them have sparkly pieces adhered to them. The center of the necklace has a large collection of faux crystals in different shapes. Some of the shapes are teardrops while others are emerald-cut. There are also two crystal sections that hang on either side of the main plate. What really surprised me was how well-made the piece was. It was heavy and didn&#8217;t feel like something from Forever 21. I like purchasing more affordable jewelry (under $20) but this piece is made with much more quality. And it was under $20 since it was on sale!</p>

<p>Near the clasp is a pretty tag with the logo on it.</p>

<p>Included in each piece of jewelry was a little card describing how to care for it. I think this is a great idea because so often I throw jewelry around without properly caring for it and then I&#8217;m bummed when it breaks or changes colors.</p>

<p>These earrings popped on the BaubleBar website and I couldn&#8217;t resist adding them to my cart. The bright neon colors and fun shapes were what caught my attention. These will look great with a simple colored t-shirt or even to dress up a cozy sweatshirt and jeans. They were marked down to $10. I think regularly they would be about $25.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-earrings-dangle.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-76 size-large" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-earrings-dangle-842x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="baublebar-earrings-dangle" width="842" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-earrings-dangle.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 842w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-earrings-dangle-247x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 247w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-earrings-dangle-768x934.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-earrings-dangle-25x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 25w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baublebar-earrings-dangle-300x365.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px" /></a></p>
<p>Look at those details! I like the size and shape. Quirky and classic at the same time.</p>
<p>BaubleBar has all types of jewelry that isn&#8217;t limited to these neon colors and style. At different times their site has a <a href="http://www.baublebar.com/guest-bartender/wendys-lookbook.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Guest Bartender</a> that will showcase different styles of baubles. In the past the brand has worked with the lovely <a href="http://www.emmaroberts.net/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Emma Roberts </a>and bloggers Erica Chan Coffman and Lauren Kolodny from <a href="http://honestlywtf.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Honestly WTF</a>.</p>
<p>The site also offers personalized options and free shipping/returns!</p>
<p>What do you think? Would you order an item from BaubleBar? Is it too pricey for you or does the quality and uniqueness of it make it worth the splurge?</p>
