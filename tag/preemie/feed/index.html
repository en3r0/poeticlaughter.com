<p>I absolutely love the cute Honest Company diapers with the apples. We haven&#8217;t been able to share the wonder and beauty of Fall with Bella outside, but have decorated and used fun Fall things around the house&#8230;like these diapers.</p>



<h2>Getting Bella Ready For Bed </h2>



<p>Before bed, we put Bella in her pajamas and hook her up to her extension set. (I read it was best to attach the tubing to her diaper. I&#8217;ve gone away from that because we change her diaper throughout the night.) What you see here is her Mini One Feeding Tube attached to her extension set. We then give meds and her feed through the extension. The extension is good for an entire week. The feeding bag, which is filled with formula and attaches to the pump, is only good for 24hrs. (Yes, we throw away a pump bag and tubing every single day. It&#8217;s a crazy amount of waste). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1174" height="880" class="wp-image-2395" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1174w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1174px) 100vw, 1174px" />
<figcaption>Trying overnight feeds the first time</figcaption>
</figure>



<h2>The First Night</h2>



<p>For the first night I had Bella sleep right next to me. I was very nervous about her strangling herself, pulling her button out, or vomiting and choking/aspirating. Here you can see Bella is hooked up to the pump tubing, IV pole, and extension set. It went amazingly. She didn&#8217;t even vomit! I woke up a lot of check on her but she seemed so happy and content. When I woke up I realized I had gotten SO MUCH SLEEP and so had she. It was crazy. I&#8217;m used to only getting 5 hours, interrupted. To switch to 8 hours was a massive blessing.</p>



<h2>Why Do Overnight Feeds Help Isabella?</h2>



<p>Overnight continuous feeds work well because Isabella has GERD (severe acid reflux) and a premature GI system. She is unable to take large volumes of formula at a time via feeding tube without throwing it up or being in pain. The goal of a continuous feed is to ensure she gets the nutrition she needs. The hope is that the very tiny amount of volume she gets per minute will be tolerated well and she will be less likely to vomit with less in her stomach. It also helps that she can rest uninterrupted. </p>



<p>Of course this is an added bonus to us! We have been on a &#8220;newborn&#8221; schedule until now (7 months) and her feeds were taking us a minimum of an hour and a half. We would need to hold her upright for an hour during the feed and then another 30 minutes to help prevent vomiting. Even then she would throw up quite a lot. To be completely honest we would bring ice packs to bed with us while feeding her to stay awake. We would blare our TV and talk to each other or watch movies. We couldn&#8217;t fall asleep during her feeds and it was very exhausting. At the time when her vomiting was at its worst we were feeding her 8x a day. To do the feed, hold her, prep the pump, etc, it was 2 hours each time. We literally spent 16 hours a day feeding Bella. </p>

</figure>



<h2>Setting Bella&#8217;s Pump, How Does It Work?</h2>



<p>The pump can be set for different rates and amounts of volume for her to receive. For Bella, we give her 30ml of a specific formula custom for her every hour. That&#8217;s 1/2 an ounce an hour. Or, 1/2ml per minute. It&#8217;s basically like an IV drip, only with formula. We allow this to run from 10pm until 9am. The formula is good to be hung for 4 hours. We wake up 2x to refill the pump bag with fresh formula mixed up and prepped in the fridge. </p>

</figure>



<h2>Why Do You Wake Up?</h2>



<p>We wake up at 2am and 6am. At this time we rewarm a bottle and add the liquid to the pump bag. We also check on Bella&#8217;s tubing, change her diaper, and check for leaking. At 2am I also give her a medication that I push through her tubing with a syringe. At 9am (or later if she&#8217;s still sleeping and we can squeeze a bit extra formula in) her alarm on her pump will sound and I will turn it off. The alarm sounds if the bag is empty, but we set our own alarms. We certainly don&#8217;t want to forget to refill the bag or else the pump will pump air into her belly! That can be very painful for a little one. Above you can see that her Gtube sometimes leaks. We have to change her outfit and sheets when this happens. </p>

<h2>Does She Still Eat During The Day?</h2>



<p>Yes! Bella still gets fed 3x during the day. We give her 75ml over an hour at 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm. She gets a little over 1ml an hour. She tolerates it rather well and usually just naps during the 12pm and 4pm feed on my chest. I still have to hold her upright for an hour and a half. Then, at the 8pm feed she falls asleep and stays asleep for the rest of the night. Of course we accidentally wake her to take her to bed and &#8220;hook her up&#8221; but she usually just groggily smiles and then falls back asleep.</p>

<figcaption>Mommy and Me Time!</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>I love feeding Bella. It&#8217;s a very special time. She snuggles up and I have an hour and a half to just be cozy with her. In the beginning I had to do this A LOT (8x a day shared with Dustin). That made it hard to do anything, including making insurance calls and eat. Now it&#8217;s only 2x a day and Dustin does 1. This 3 hours is helpful to slow down and rest. Above is my setup for Bella&#8217;s feeds. I&#8217;m tethered to her and her pump so I make sure to empty my bladder, get anything I want nearby and get comfy! I just finished a fun book called Girl Wash Your Face. </p>

<h2>Overnight Feeding Has It&#8217;s Challenges</h2>



<p>So, sleeping almost all night and not waking up every few hours is amazing. It&#8217;s so crazy awesome. BUT, there are some challenges with overnight feeds.</p>



<p>Bella moves around a lot and can pull on her button.</p>



<p>We alter her sleepers if they don&#8217;t have snaps by cutting a hole in them for the tubing. I run these down her leg to help keep her from tugging on the tubing or getting it caught around her neck. It&#8217;s actually pretty hard to find a ton of snap sleepers that are warm! So, we use zipper ones and just alter them ourselves. </p>



<p>We just recently began running the tubing through an empty paper towel roll to help keep it from away her head.</p>



<p>Sometimes if the button is pulled she leaks all over herself and the bed. We have to change out her clothing and the bedding. </p>



<p>The friction on her button causes her to break out. She can get skin breakdown near her stoma (stomach hole). So we have to keep bandages on it and rash cream to keep it from bleeding. </p>



<p>Sometimes I worry about her silently aspirating the formula into her lungs. If she does it silently after vomiting, I have no way of knowing or stopping the pump if I&#8217;m asleep. I&#8217;ve had to simply give this fear to God and trust that Bella is big enough to turn her head and spit formula out. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="660" height="880" class="wp-image-2434" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" />

</figure>



<h2>Overall, It&#8217;s the Right Choice For Bella </h2>



<p>Continuous overnight feeds has certainly helped Bella so much. She still vomits at least once during the night or morning, but it&#8217;s not a lot of formula! Sometimes she&#8217;ll go all night not vomiting and will simply wake up throwing up a small volume! I don&#8217;t even have to change her bedding. For us, this is awesome. She was throwing up 5+ times a night before and not gaining the weight she desperately needed. Now, she seems to be hitting new milestones and seems to rested. We&#8217;ve put off continuous feeds during the day, to keep her from being hooked up all the time, and hope we can keep avoiding it by doing this. We can also avoid certain medications to empty her stomach quicker and a GJ tube which puts formula into her small intestine! </p>

<p>Also, note, our bed is made! Thanks to the extra sleep I was getting. I can&#8217;t remember when I took the above pictures, but you better believe the bed is made now almost every day thanks to the restful night and clean bedding with no throw up! </p>

<p>Isabella is doing very well! We have been doing continuous feeds overnight for about a week now. She is sleeping through the night and seems to be growing so much better. She doesn&#8217;t vomit at night as much and seems to be able to sleep peacefully while being fed. That&#8217;s crazy!</p>
<h2>Below are a few &#8220;real&#8221; posts about Isabella&#8217;s struggle</h2>
<p>This is what a life looks like with Bella. It&#8217;s so hard to see her in pain, but we are so glad she is improving. I wanted to share some &#8220;realness&#8221; with you to get a small glimpse into our daily struggle.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2391" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2391" style="width: 527px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1014.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2391" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1014.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="527" height="703" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1014.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1014-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1014-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2391" class="wp-caption-text">Vomiting with dad</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Although her tummy still gets upset and she does vomit, it&#8217;s not as much. Bella moves more and thus has a pretty good aim for mommy/daddy&#8217;s face. Here Bella projected all over the couch and Dustin&#8217;s mouth! Ew!</p>
<p>She&#8217;s in pain a lot from her feeds. Here, below I captured her hurting. We can&#8217;t not feed her, so we have to pause and restart her pump until she can handle it.</p>

<p><figure id="attachment_2390" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2390" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0892.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2390" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0892-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0892-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0892-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0892-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0892-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0892.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2390" class="wp-caption-text">laundry</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Above is the amount of laundry we have after just one trip to Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital. There are usually at least 5 burp cloths, a change of clothes for me and her, and blankets.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2389" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2389" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0774.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2389" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0774.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="660" height="880" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0774.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0774-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0774-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2389" class="wp-caption-text">bedding</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 17px;">Every night we change Bella&#8217;s bedding (before continuous feeds) sometimes up to 5x a night. Currently we only change it once! Above you can see we are changing out her clothes, burp cloth, and bedding. </span></p>
<p>Below, Dustin helping to soothe Bella and catch her vomit.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2388" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2388" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0689.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2388" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0689.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="660" height="880" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0689.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0689-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0689-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2388" class="wp-caption-text">Daddy catches vomit</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly not glamorous, but we do our best to keep a positive outlook. We use a ton of baby wipes and burp clothes. Bella&#8217;s still too tiny to give a bath every time she vomits or else she&#8217;d be burning a lot of calories she desperately needs to grow.</p>
<h2>The Current Diagnosis</h2>
<p><figure id="attachment_2399" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2399" style="width: 615px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1284.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2399" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1284-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="615" height="461" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1284-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1284-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1284-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1284-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1284.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2399" class="wp-caption-text">Getting ready to eat while sleeping</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Currently the Gastroenterologists have agreed that Bella has severe GERD/reflux and a premature GI system. We did many tests to explore her vomiting further and nothing critical came to light. At this point, we will settle with the diagnosis. Of course she&#8217;s not gaining as well as she should, but she is gaining! We will celebrate this!</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2401" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2401" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1318.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2401" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1318-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1318-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1318-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1318-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1318-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1318.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2401" class="wp-caption-text">she moves so much in her sleep!</figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>The Tests</h2>
<p>We did the following tests to rule out anything underlying. Full blood work, Upper GI, Gastric Emptying Test, PH Probe, Barium Enema, and multiple Xrays. Her care team and I agree that there&#8217;s no need currently to do further testing, such as a scope.</p>
<h2>The Solution(s)</h2>
<p><figure id="attachment_2396" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2396" style="width: 409px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1230.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2396" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1230.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="409" height="546" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1230.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1230-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1230-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2396" class="wp-caption-text">her pump at night</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Our current solution to her vomiting and not gaining as well as she should is the following:</p>
<h4>Her Special Diet:</h4>
<p><figure id="attachment_2393" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2393" style="width: 525px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1152.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2393" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1152.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="525" height="700" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1152.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1152-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1152-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2393" class="wp-caption-text">Elecare</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Her formula is fortified to be 30 calories per ounce. We use Elecare which is hypoallergenic and easy to digest. We also add Polycal which adds calories. During the day we mix in Beechnut Rice Cereal.</p>
<h4>Continuous Feeds/Bolus Feeds</h4>
<p><figure id="attachment_2398" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2398" style="width: 501px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1283.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2398" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1283-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="501" height="376" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1283-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1283-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1283-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1283-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1283.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2398" class="wp-caption-text">continuous feeds</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>We now do continuous overnight feeds. That means Bella gets fed from 10pm until 9am. I&#8217;ll have to write much more on this. This is a great solution because she can handle a small amount of formula while laying down. This also ensures she&#8217;s getting nutrition without throwing it up. She receives 330ml and gets 30ml over an hour. We wake up to refill the bag and also to change her diaper twice. She can usually sleep through it&#8230;or wakes up, smiles, and goes back to sleep. She usually vomits once per night.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2397" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1269.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2397" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1269.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="500" height="667" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1269.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1269-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1269-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2397" class="wp-caption-text">bella before night feed</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Bolus feeds, or one time larger feeds, are given three times during the day. They happen at 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm. We give her 75ml over an hour. Sadly, she is throwing up quite a bit during the day still, but we know the continuous feed overnight helps make sure she&#8217;s not losing too much.</p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p><figure id="attachment_2386" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2386" style="width: 423px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0387.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2386" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0387.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="423" height="564" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0387.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0387-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0387-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2386" class="wp-caption-text">giving meds</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Isabella is on medications to help manage her GI issues. She takes both Omeprazole (commonly recognized as Nexium/Prilosec/Etc.) and Famotidine (otherwise known as Pepcid). Both of these work together to help her stomach acid and relieve her stomach upset. Omeprazole blocks the acid production of the stomach and Famotidine, which as I understand it, decreases the amount of acid.</p>

<p>Bella throws up when she&#8217;s moved after a feed. To combat this, we hold her upright for at least 30 minutes after her daytime feeds. If we sit her down too soon, she usually vomits. This makes each feed at least an hour and a half. One hour for the pump and 30 minutes to hold. I don&#8217;t mind cuddles at this point, but she&#8217;s getting bigger and wanting to move around more!</p>
<p>Many of you asked about her esophagus muscles. We asked as well. We know they are premature and not developed well. This means that she&#8217;s unable to protect her airway or keep food down. We know this from a swallow study we did in the NICU. That being said, the specialists have explained that this will improve in time and there&#8217;s no need for surgery.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2400" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2400" style="width: 423px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1306.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2400" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1306.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="423" height="564" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1306.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1306-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1306-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2400" class="wp-caption-text">sitting in her sit-me-up-chair</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Thanks to some amazing friends, (Thank you Mr/Mrs. Hower!) we now have a sit-me-up-seat that can help her eat while playing. I&#8217;ve been working with her to get used to it and so far she loves sitting in it. Hopefully soon she can eat while in it and not fall asleep!</p>
<h2>Other Options</h2>
<p>Other solutions are still on the table for Isabella. We can switch to continuous feeds all day and all night, utilize medications that help her stomach empty faster, or have a GJ tube inserted in place of her current Gtube. For now, we are going to continue with the overnight feeds and pray we can avoid other options. Of course we are willing to explore them if needed.</p>

<h2>Thank You &amp; Not Being Able To Respond Sometimes</h2>
<p>Thank you again for all of your love and support. I&#8217;m so sorry I&#8217;m not able to fully respond to all comments. I try to but sometimes I&#8217;m just so busy! I read each one and am so moved by all of your continued support and love for Bella. I am so excited that as she gets bigger she can meet many of you!</p>
<p>Love Love,</p>

<h2>How Are Things?</h2>
<p>Yesterday (as I edit this, 2 days ago) Isabella turned 7 months old! This is such a crazy milestone! We are over 1/2 way through her first year. We spent her first 3 1/2 months in the NICU and have been able to celebrate 4, 5, 6, and now 7 at home! When your child is medically fragile or had a rough start to life, you celebrate every milestone possible!</p>
<p>So, where are things? How is Isabella doing? I get this question (as does everyone who knows Bella well) asked often. It&#8217;s a hard question to answer. The answer isn&#8217;t necessarily &#8220;bad&#8221; but it&#8217;s not quite &#8220;great.&#8221; I usually say she&#8217;s a very happy and content baby. She loves life and is growing. Then I say that she is struggling with excessive vomiting and that there are some health concerns. This is a great summary. It&#8217;s kind of like &#8220;Thank you for asking! We&#8217;re OK. She&#8217;s OK. Life is so great at home. But, please don&#8217;t leave me off your prayer list yet. We&#8217;re still in it. We&#8217;re living and loving it but also struggling sometimes.&#8221; I don&#8217;t typically even begin to explain the stress of the hour-to-two-hour feeds, the unending  vomit laundry, the financial stress, the lack of sleep, or grieving  not being able to have more children. But I&#8217;m so thankful and happy and grateful. It&#8217;s a mixed bag of emotions.</p>

<h2>Making Myself Post An Update</h2>
<p class="p1">I had a few minutes to write today. 30 to be exact. As I look up at the clock I see that Bella’s next feed begins at 7:00pm. She’s playing peacefully in her rock n’ play with her turtle toy, wrapped up in a pretty crocheted pink blanket.</p>
<p class="p1">I didn’t want to write. Even though I know I always feel better and I know others want to know how Bella’s evaluation went…I’d rather lay back on the couch. I pulled up my blog and it didn’t come up. Probably some simple technical error Dustin will fix when we gets home from having coffee with a good friend.</p>
<p class="p1">It seems as if there’s a million reasons to NOT write, but I realize and have been inspired by a book (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Wash-Your-Face-Believing-ebook/dp/B072TMB75T?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Girl Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis</a>) I’m reading to push through the roadblocks and make this a priority. That being said, Bella’s beginning to screech a bit so my 30 minutes may be less.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Let’s jump right in!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0863-e1538529121438.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2351" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0863-e1538529121438-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0863-e1538529121438-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0863-e1538529121438-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0863-e1538529121438-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<h2>NICU Established Pediatric Development Assessment</h2>
<p class="p1">Yesterday we headed up to Akron as a family! Dustin usually has to work but decided to take the day off since it was a bigger day than usual and we had Bella’s Neonatal Follow-Up Clinic.</p>
<p class="p1">The night before and morning were ROUGH. Bella vomitted<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>so much on the way there, soaking her sleeper and causing her to cough and retch. It was really heartbreaking. She finally fell asleep as we jumped on the highway. The sun didn’t come up until we began to reach Akron. Each of us were lucky to get 4 hours of sleep. We ate Burger King breakfast and drank coffee. I tried not to nod off in the back seat with Bella. We couldn’t find anything good on the radio either.</p>
<p class="p1">First up was Bella’s feed. We got unloaded and headed into Akron Children’s Hospital. Bella needed her feed before her appointment so we were there early. While signing in, we got to run into one of our primary nurses, Jackie, who took our family on when Bella was only 3 days old! I was so embarrassed Bella (and us) looked like a hot mess, but she was so encouraging and loved seeing how chubby Bella has become. Also, she’s pregnant! Her little one is passed the gestational age of Bella when she met her. Crazy!</p>
<p class="p1">Next, we sleepily headed up to the floor and began prepping her feed. We all went into the family bathroom and I also changed her into a cute outfit. Bella was hungry. Surprisingly the nurses came out after we got her feed ready and said they could put us in a room and get her ready for the appointment! How great! So we ended up getting in right away. We saw a nurse that did Bella’s weight and vitals and then another nurse that did a full interview about Bella and her health.</p>
<p class="p1">We had begun her feed but warned the nurses of her vomiting. After she’d gotten some food, we held her and the nurse began her testing. Holding a colored ring in front of her, tracking her eyes, etc. At this point Bella began projectile vomiting over the office. She was retching and lost her whole feed. Dustin’s on the floor trying to mop up the puddles of vomit and I’m soaked and trying to catch it in a burp cloth. The nurse looked shocked. She asked “is this what it’s like all the time?” We nodded and I began to cry. Of course it was agreed upon that we needed to continue testing and solving this massive issue. The vomiting aside, things went great!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0867-e1538529560943.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2352" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0867-e1538529560943-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0867-e1538529560943-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0867-e1538529560943-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0867-e1538529560943-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">We got Bella cleaned up (and myself a bit) and prepared for the doctor. Doctor Langkamp came in and was super friendly. She had another doctor that was learning with her. She immediately took to Bella and Bella soaked up the attention. Laying on the exam table, Isabella was tested in different ways. The doctor held her up, checked her reflexes, checked her eyes, busted out colored toys to Bella’s delight and “talked” with her as she<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>babbled and cooed.</p>
<p class="p1">She asked us if we had any concerns.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Yes. A Million.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I tried to think back to my list and zero in on the most important things.</p>
<p class="p1">Question: The vomiting. Could this be an underlying syndrome? Something like a bigger disorder. Answer: That’s highly unlikely.</p>
<p class="p1">Question: Her ears (one is folded over). Could this be a sign of a genetic issue? Answer: Probably not, no. But you’re past the time for a quick fix. She’d probably need surgery…I responded that we didn’t mind it. I actually find it cute. We just wanted to make sure it wasn’t an issue.</p>
<p class="p1">Question: How will we know if she has any neurological disorders? Answer: Well, we won’t really know until 12 months. We don’t typically see issues this early on. But things are looking really great and her risk is low.</p>
<p class="p1">Question: Her tongue and lip look tied. We had a referral to a dentist but that didn’t sit well with us. What are your thoughts? Answer: She can put her tongue out great. It could certainly be attached in the back, but in my years of experience this isn’t an issue at all. There’s no need to have this looked at further.</p>
<p class="p1">Question: Bella’s getting big and more active. She doesn’t want to be held during feeds but needs to sit upright or else she vomits and loses food. Any chair suggestions? Answer: Her Physical Therapists like a Fisher Price Sit Me Up Chair. (Added to my list!)</p>
<p class="p1">Question: Can you think of any other tests Gastroenterology could be doing (for the vomiting)? Answer: No. It’s not my area of expertise. They do a great job (which we agreed with), but I’m surprised she’s not on a medication to help empty her stomach quicker. We will ask about this next.</p>

<h2>The Hard Question</h2>
<p class="p1">At the end of the assessment. The doctor sat and reviewed everything with us. Of course she wanted Bella to be bigger, but she explained she was very impressed with Bella and that we were doing everything right. I’m a gold star kinda gal…so this made me feel good. <strong>Although in my mind I reminded myself that this wasn’t about US, this was about God and his mighty work in her.</strong> Although I work with Bella and try to be a good steward of my time with her and being her momma, ultimately it’s God’s mercy and love that helps Bella grow and develop. <strong>Also, if she were doing worse for wear…that wouldn’t be a direct reflection of our bad parenting or lack of faith or God’s lack of love for Bella. It’s vital to keep these things in mind when parenting a child with medical needs.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I asked the question I was most scared about again, only more directly.</p>
<p class="p1">Will Bella have any cognitive issues or delays?</p>
<p class="p1">Answer: We can’t say for sure, but things look good and I wouldn’t worry about it. Honestly, you have plenty enough to worry about. (Amen, sister. I like this lady already).</p>
<p class="p1">I probed a little bit further. She explained we probably wouldn’t see issues until about 12 months. But that things looked good. Having her have a brain MRI earlier on also gives me some confidence, too. (She had one in NICU).</p>
<p>We were referred for a (routine) hearing test with audiology (yet another specialist) and advised to keep up with GI. Dr. Langkamp said &#8220;Enjoy her, she&#8217;s a delight.&#8221; Bella kept grinning and babbling all the way out.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0882-e1538529927744.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2356" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0882-e1538529927744-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0882-e1538529927744-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0882-e1538529927744-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0882-e1538529927744-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<h2>(TLDR) A Quick Summary</h2>
<p>Isabella impressed the Pediatric Development Doctor. She is still small and is in the less than 1% for her age but she is making excellent progress in developments. The doctor loved how interactive she was and seemed really affirmative. Later, we received a letter said she scored a 9/11 for the<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article/26/1/33/893255?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"> Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental Screening</a>. This puts her at low to moderate risk. She was able to do a lot of the activities but struggled to sit with slight support for 10 seconds and had no interest in their white little pellet.</p>
<p>In the doctor&#8217;s own words:</p>
<div>&#8220;Medical Decision Making: Isabella is a former 27 week gestation preterm infant who has shown excellent progress in development. Developmentally, she is functioning at an appropriate level for her age adjusted for prematurity. With respect to her chronologic age, she shows delays in milestones. She is making slow progress in growth and continues to have frequent emesis and GERD. I recommend that she continue with GI and nutrition for further management of her growth. I do not recommend starting oral feeds at this time. I recommend having her upright in a high chair at the table when her family is eating. We discussed possible use of Fisher Price Sit-Me-Up floor seat. She will be due for hearing test in 3 months.&#8221;</div>

<p>So, there&#8217;s the current update.</p>
<p>We actually headed over to Pediatric Dermatology after for a general follow-up &#8230;but that&#8217;s an update for another day.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining in the crazy. We love you,</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Saturday and Dustin is feeding Bella. I snuck away to write a few quick words on here!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so so happy to share these amazing family photographs with you. As I mentioned in my <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/27-weeker-micropreemie-photoshoot/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">blog post before</a>, having photos done in the NICU was amazing and special&#8230;but I dreamed of family photos outside of the hospital walls! Oh&#8230;and having Bella unhooked from all the wires!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll note that in these pictures she&#8217;s about 6 months old. The ones from the NICU were taken when she was 14 days old.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2300" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-300x200.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-768x511.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-640x426.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Teresa Young of Teresa Young Photography made this dream a reality and came to our home to take photographs of us in our backyard. She was so incredibly flexible. In fact, the day we had scheduled for her to take our photos, <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/im-getting-tired-of-the-er-when-bellas-gtube-falls-out-pt1/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Bella&#8217;s feeding tube fell out</a> and we had to head to Akron, an hour and a half away. We had to cancel!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2316" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-681x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="681" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-681x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 681w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-200x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 200w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-768x1154.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-640x962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /></a></p>
<p>So we rescheduled. She came over and was so kind and amazing. She even went for hand sanitizer before I awkwardly needed to ask! (Loving acts that speak to a preemie momma&#8217;s soul!) It was so nice to have her meet Bella, since I don&#8217;t get to share her with many people. We waited until the last minute to put our coordinated outfits on for fear of Bella vomiting on all of them. This was a great decision since she did in fact throw up all over herself and Dustin right before Teresa walked in the door!</p>

<p>I stressed so much about everything looking &#8220;perfect.&#8221; In the end I was just thankful that we were alive. And here. And able to take photos. I even considered paying someone to paint our fence (it only got one coat last season)&#8230;but that was silly and Teresa assured me she could make the photos look nice in our less-than-perfect backyard. She was right!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2320" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-682x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="682" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-682x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 682w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-200x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 200w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-768x1154.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-640x962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a></p>
<p>Bella was nervous. She really hasn&#8217;t been outside much and it was her very first time on a blanket in the grass! It was very humid and I was sweating buckets. My makeup was sweating off! BUT&#8230;Teresa did such a great job that when I see these&#8230;my eyes don&#8217;t immediately go to the imperfections&#8230;but to the joy we all have. Even though Bella wouldn&#8217;t give us a smile&#8230;she looks healthy and relaxed. She also looks very inquisitive.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2308" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4-300x200.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4-768x511.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery4-640x426.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest&#8230;my thoughts did go to her birthmark. (The large red bump on her scalp) I can be a little insecure about it still from time to time. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/whats-on-her-head-a-hemangioma-story/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">We&#8217;re treating it because it was harming her,</a> but we probably would treat it regardless at this point for cosmetic reasons. I&#8217;m all for loving yourself as God made you&#8230;but this in particular can give her issues down the road and is a quick and mild fix. That all being said, I love it because it&#8217;s a part of her and what makes her, her. I&#8217;ve grown to accept it as who God&#8217;s made her&#8230;but know that if there&#8217;s a solution that will improve her quality of life&#8230;I&#8217;m going to take it. Especially if it&#8217;s not harming her. My eye does go to the red bump&#8230;as I&#8217;m sure other&#8217;s do, but I&#8217;m not sad about it anymore.</p>
<p>As my Grandma said &#8220;If that&#8217;s the only thing she&#8217;s taking out of the NICU with her&#8230;we can rejoice&#8221; Or as Dustin says lovingly &#8220;She&#8217;s so beautiful&#8230;maybe God put it there to keep her humble.&#8221; haha</p>

<p>These photos are what I dreamed of. They&#8217;re as &#8220;Pinterest Perfect&#8221; as they come&#8230;but not because they were from a perfect situation. They&#8217;re perfect because they represent a warrior in this little one. A dedicated village. A sense of determination and grit and heart. The represent the heart of our God. That he loves us and wants us to grow in Him.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2342" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1-300x200.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1-768x511.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1-640x426.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>So excuse me while I go cry in a corner with a handful of Hershey Kisses while reflecting on the simplicity and beauty that Teresa captured.  Here&#8217;s a post on Facebook that I made as soon as I saw the photographs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before Bella was born&#8230;before I was pregnant with her&#8230;before our miscarriage last year&#8230;I filled Pinterest boards with newborn photography. I dreamed of our little family&#8230;perfected behind a creative lens. I virtually &#8220;shopped&#8221; for outfits and themes.</p>
<p>After we lost our first pregnancy I deleted those boards&#8230;there wouldn&#8217;t be any newborn pictures.</p>
<p>But then we found out months later we were expecting Isabella. My faith in God gave me the courage to embrace hope. Hope t<span class="text_exposed_show">hat this little soul would be in family photos. Once again I filled inspiration boards&#8230;as the months went by they became tailored to a little baby girl <span class="_5mfr _47e3"><img loading="lazy" class="img" role="presentation" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/f3/1/16/1f380.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="16" height="16" /><span class="_7oe">?</span></span></span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>As much as we can plan, God directs our lives. I hadn&#8217;t dreamt that Bella would be born 3 months early and we would spend 110 days in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. I never imagined it&#8217;d take 60 days for my own mother to touch her&#8230;or almost 6 months for these precious precious family photographs.</p>
<p>While in the hospital a photographer took pictures of us when Bella was only 14 days old. Not yet 2lbs&#8230;these photos are now so special&#8230;even with her wires, no clothing, and cpap on. Yet&#8230;I still dreamed and hoped for pictures of our sweet girl free of hospital walls.</p>
<p>The road to these photographs is marked with loss, heart break, confusion, joy, peace, fear, and more. The truth that we are even physically here in these pictures does not fall short on us. We miss our first little one terribly, but are so thankful Bella and I are here. Tears run down my cheeks as I realize my dream of family photos has been honored by our amazing God.</p>
<p>And then, to add that the amazingly talented young women and friend who captured these has children of her own..and one who has/is facing medical challenges&#8230;blows me away. Teresa Young was so gracious and flexible. We had to cancel on her because Bella&#8217;s gtube fell out. We didn&#8217;t have our fence painted or even our own blanket to pose on&#8230;but she came to our home and captured these for us&#8230;at no charge. She used hand sanitizer without me prompting and understood how fragile Bella was and how she was one of the very first non-family members to meet her. I was sweating buckets and Bella was nervous being near grass for the first time&#8230;but it worked. These pictures are so anticipated and treasured. The power of God working through Teresa is incredible. Please, consider getting family photos done. Things don&#8217;t have to be perfect. You don&#8217;t have to be your goal weight or have everything figured out. I was terrified Bella would vomit all over. I was worried her birthmark would look weird. (She didn&#8217;t and it doesn&#8217;t). Whatever is holding you back, don&#8217;t let it. You won&#8217;t regret it. Consider Teresa Young. She&#8217;s amazing. Thank you for creating something priceless for me. And sending them at the perfect time&#8230;when there&#8217;s fear and uncertainty and nervousness in my heart for my sweet girl.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just be over here crying&#8230;and thinking up ways to display this dream realized in our home.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the greatest gifts we&#8217;ve received are professional photographs taken in the NICU. These were taken while Bella was only 14 days old. I remember signing up so excitedly on the paper sign up sheet in the family lounge and then crying when I realized she would have her cpap (breathing help/mask thing) on. I walked back up and began crossing our names off the list. But Dustin looked at me and said &#8220;Tiffany, we want these pictures. We have nothing to be embarrassed about. This is her right now. This is her journey.&#8221; It&#8217;s true! I&#8217;m so glad we didn&#8217;t wait until she looked &#8220;ideal&#8221; to take these photos. This was us. This was her. This was our reality.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2204" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179-1024x819.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="819" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179-1024x819.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179-300x240.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179-768x614.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179-640x512.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-179.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>But of course I struggled when I looked down at her and the photographer walked into the room. I even asked the nurses if we could sneak the cpap off for a few photos. (So silly of me). I was still very much overwhelmed and in a lot of pain from my emergency c-section. I was also pumping like crazy, living in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, taking pain killers, taking blood pressure medication, and trying to be a mom. It was one of the hardest times of my life yet it was filled with so much peace and joy. I believe that this is reflected in these photos.</p>

<p>To be honest, I almost didn&#8217;t want anyone to see these. Bella looks&#8230;scary. Kind of like an animal. She doesn&#8217;t really look like the cuddly baby you imagine or see in pictures. BUT we loved her all the same and I held onto hope that she would grow and develop into a beautiful little one&#8230;and God didn&#8217;t put that hope to shame!</p>

<p>Looking back, I carefully curated things I shared with the world. Dustin and I always wanted the way we presented our story to be a story of hope and love. We wanted Bella to be able to look back and be proud of how we shared her journey. I believe we have been good stewards of this. Some questioned early on&#8230;including us&#8230;if we should share so transparently about our journey. I know it&#8217;s not for everyone&#8230;and not everyone is called to it&#8230;but we felt we were called by the Lord to share Isabella with everyone in a public way.</p>

<p>From the day years ago that God told me I&#8217;d have a daughter and to name her Isabella Melody we&#8217;ve known she would be used greatly in His Kingdom.</p>

<p>So, I share these photographs to inspire others and give them a HOPE. You probably are looking up viability of a 27 weeker or maybe you are in the NICU and hope your baby will look a bit different as the month go on. (They will).</p>

<p>Isabella was born at 27 weeks but only weighed 1 lb 7 ounces due to restricted growth. I had an emergency cesarean that I was put under for since I had severe preeclampsia and stage 2 HELLP Syndrome that threatened my life.</p>

<p>If you notice the shock and awe of this image&#8230;it&#8217;s because this was the very first time I held Bella cradled in my arms and without doing skin to skin! For 14 days I had only held her chest to chest and while doing kangaroo care (skin to skin).</p>

<p>As the days passed her coloring got better, she grew, and medical devices and medications were slowly taken away. Now, she is 6 months old and doing great. She has a feeding tube due to silent aspiration but other than that she is a healthy, happy baby.</p>

<p>If you look closely you can see the strange white hair that covered her entire little body. This is called lanugo and went away after awhile. She was very fragile at this time to we used help getting her out of the isolette and she wasn&#8217;t moved around too much.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have to post more about this information, but she doesn&#8217;t have clothing on because she was in a controlled warm isolette and she needed to be seen by nurses/doctors. As she grew she could wear clothing&#8230;around 1 month or so.</p>
<p>I want to thank Simon Says Smile for this amazing gift to us. This is a volunteer program offered through <a href="http://www.blackdogphotoco.com/index.html/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Black Dog Photo Co.</a> They came and did this photo shoot free of charge. (AND later helped us when we accidentally overrode these pictures). AMAZING people.</p>
<p>Lastly, we had another amazing photo shoot done by Teresa Young. She also gifted these amazing photos to us. This was a very emotional moment as I had dreamed of some &#8220;normal&#8221; looking images of my tribe. Here&#8217;s a little teaser and I&#8217;ll post the rest another time.</p>

<p>Curious about her birthmark on her scalp? It&#8217;s called a hemangioma. It&#8217;s a superficial birth mark. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/whats-on-her-head-a-hemangioma-story/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Learn more from this post.</a></p>

<p>BUT there&#8217;s a revolution happening. Freedom from having it all together. Women supporting women. Moms admitting that they&#8217;re flying by the seat of their pants. It&#8217;s empowering and&#8230;helps us feel a little less alone in this life.</p>
<p>So&#8230;let me take a moment and a pause from the super cute pictures of Bella (that I go through and delete the blurry ones) and the fun updates that include emojis. These things reflect the real me. They&#8217;re the real Bella. But they aren&#8217;t always the nitty gritty realness that&#8217;s born from confidence and courage. So let me share more into our story, Because YOU reach out to me. You tell me this inspires you.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2197" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197" style="width: 768px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9865-e1536803931211.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2197" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9865-e1536803931211-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9865-e1536803931211-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9865-e1536803931211-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9865-e1536803931211-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9865-e1536803931211.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 960w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2197" class="wp-caption-text">Doing what we do best&#8230;netflix &amp; tube feed!</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I ever set out to inspire anyone by our story. To be honest I was just looking for friends&#8230;someone else who was up at 3am in a hospital room in a new, unknown city&#8230;wincing in pain from a major surgery but wanting to focus energy on a 1 1/2lb baby laying under bilirubin lights. What I know is through this sharing I&#8217;ve connected with others in a unique way and I&#8217;m so thankful for it. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So I&#8217;ll always be honest with you.</strong></span> I&#8217;ll always be positive and confident in the hope of Christ but I&#8217;ll always keep things real. So let me begin&#8230;</p>

Yes, that is projectile vomit on the floor of our bedroom. How it goes that far? I don&#8217;t know.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The last 2 days have sucked. I&#8217;ve ugly cried more than I have in weeks. I&#8217;ve said hurtful things to Dustin. I&#8217;ve been angry at myself. My head hurts and I&#8217;m exhausted. I&#8217;m also on my period which intensifies all of this and makes me feel like a sack of potatoes.</p>
<p>Numerous things have made me feel this way. We found out we have a larger minimum on a huge bill from my hospitalization that we need to move around finances to afford. Last night we realized we accidentally overrode the pictures from our NICU photo shoot (Update: They Have Been Restored!!!!!)</p>
<p>Due to frustrations and frantically trying to locate the pictures we didn&#8217;t get to sleep until 2am&#8230;so I did the 3-5 and 7-9 shift so Dustin could rest. Today I got calls from the hospital that I mailed in the wrong part of Bella&#8217;s medical device for her ph probe, I was on the phone for over 30min fixing a billing issue with our insurance, and I learned our formula is still needing paperwork done before getting mailed to us.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2198" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198" style="width: 768px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9885-e1536804360959.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2198" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9885-e1536804360959-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9885-e1536804360959-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9885-e1536804360959-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9885-e1536804360959-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2198" class="wp-caption-text">Late night feeds can be fun&#8230;when we&#8217;re not exhausted!</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Bella&#8217;s gtube is leaking and she&#8217;s teething. After beginning her feed this morning I tried to give her meds and the liquid sprayed all over my face and her. She ended up vomiting her whole feed down my chest and hers. I laid in dried vomit for 2hrs so she could rest on my chest with a blanket between us topless after taking my vomit soaked shirt off. My hair&#8217;s greasy and my legs are all kinds of hairy (TMI?).</p>
<p>Bella smells like spit up even though we just gave her a bath and her pump has been malfunctioning, throwing us off schedule. My floors are sticky from dripped formula from the pump/pump bags but I don&#8217;t have the time to mop them. I&#8217;m caught up on laundry but Dustin and I argued last night and said hurtful things because we were sleep deprived and sad over losing the pictures. All in all I feel like a mess.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BUT &#8230; </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gods been speaking to me in the midst of the crazy.</strong></span> He tells me I&#8217;m his and he loves Bella and I and Dustin. He says <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>loves worth fighting</strong></span> for and saying I&#8217;m sorry is hard but so worth it. Serving each other. Sharing Oreos and pouring coffee keeps us going. Smiling over Bella&#8217;s new way she grabs her toes or tries to giggle warms my heart and helps me know this is all worth it. Money will be tight but Gods got all the money in the world and I just need to be still. I try to be childlike in motherhood. I try to rely on the Spirit to guide me. I try to be playful. I try to take one moment at a time. I throw my hands up a lot. I don&#8217;t have many answers. All I know is where I end God begins and He&#8217;s caring for us.</p>

Also, I love this shirt. Everything is better when we&#8217;re together baby doll.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>So today was hard.</p>
<p>Then I got a text from a friend. We&#8217;ve been using honest company diapers. They work the best for Bella. She has sensitive skin and they&#8217;re the best fit. But they&#8217;re pricey. There&#8217;s been 3+ friends who said they have them on sale at TJ Maxx. Last time I ran out after Dustin got off work to watch Bella but size 1s were all gone. Today a friend texted me a picture and told me they were there and they&#8217;re thinking of us and love us. How thoughtful! In that moment I felt as if God had created this wonderful village around us..even though 99% haven&#8217;t met Bella in person.</p>
<h4>But then God took it to another level.</h4>
<p>This lovely person texted me there were gifts on our porch for us. I was tethered to Bella and couldn&#8217;t stop her feed/hold so I waited until Dustin came up to retrieve the items. He explained excitedly as he brought in lots of honest co diapers all in Bella&#8217;s size. There was also a Starbucks coffee for me!!! I have been trying to save money so I do cut back on Starbucks or other items&#8230;I drink coffee at home (somehow there&#8217;s always room in the budget for ice cream though lol) so this was a real treat!!! We both took turns sipping the chocolatey caffeine goodness.</p>
<p>But before then Dustin read a hand written message on the cup out loud in our living room. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I believe strongly in the power of our words.</strong></span> Our words give life. Our words are so important. To hear Dustin deliver this message over our family brought me to tears.</p>
<p>In the midst of a hard day, from the handwriting of a special friend, on a coffee cup, Dustin read over the clanking of the feeding pump</p>
<h4>&#8220;may God fill this day with wonder, joy, and assurance of his presence.&#8221;</h4>

<p>Yesterday we headed up to Akron Children’s Hospital for 2 doctor visits. Isabella was to see Dr. Nguyen who is a Pediatric Dermatologist for her Hemangiomas and Dr. Carter Kent, a GastroIntestinal Specialist to address her vomiting, pain while eating, weight issues, and liver ultrasound.</p>
<h2>Hemangiomas, Treatment Is Working!</h2>
<p>Last week we did in clinic time at Dr. Nguyen&#8217;s office. Isabella began propranolol for her Hemangiomas and she had a liver/stomach/etc ultrasound to rule out extra internal Hemangiomas. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/whats-on-her-head-a-hemangioma-story/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">See this post to see what they are and why we’re treating them</a>. We began 0.5ml of propranolol and so far I’ve noticed a difference on her scalp birthmark. It seems as if it is shrinking. It is still sore, but doesn’t seem to be growing. Bella hasn’t had any adverse reactions to the drug. Her hands/feet get colder and she seems a tad bit sleepier, but so far, so good. We arrived around 8:30am after an hour and a half drive and got everything packed up. After running to the bathroom we went to the office and then were brought to an exam room. Bella’s vitals were taken and Dr. Nguyen visited with us and checked in on how her medication was going. We also apply a antibiotic cream to prevent infection on the ulceration three times a day.</p>

She has a feeding pump and a bag of formula hung in the backpack!</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The doctor then had us give Bella the new dose of 1ml of the medication. Bella can’t take medications by mouth so we use her gtube site. I pull up the medication with a syringe and then use the extension set to give it to her. We flush it with formula. We time it so that she gets her feed at the same time as her medicine. I set up our pump for the first time away from home and we used the backpack. It went really well. My mom held Bella while it went in. The nurses came back every 30min to check Bella and her vitals. She did great. At that point we were cleared to leave and headed straight to the GI department. We will continue to give propranolol and the cream every day and we will see them again in a month. Isabella will be on this for a least a year. We are hoping to avoid laser treatments and/or surgery!</p>
<h2>GI, We Need To Rule Out Some Things</h2>
<p><strong>UPDATE: We received Isabella&#8217;s blood work today and it all seemed within normal ranges! This should rule out diseases/cancer. One thing down, now, the anatomical issues left to rule out. Praise Jesus! </strong></p>

<p>It was our first time meeting with GI. Bella has always spit up to a degree but nothing like she’s been doing recently. We have seen our pediatrician and tried two different medications, a formula change, and a pump, and nothing seems to be helping. This is very critical since Isabella is less than 1% in weight for her actual age. She is not gaining appropriately and throwing up, choking, spitting, gagging, and in pain when she is fed.</p>
<p>I loved Dr. Carter Kent. Instead of tears and terrified questions I was excited for answers and knew we were in the right department. To begin, they weighed Bella and took her height. Then the doctor joined us and got a quick history of Bella’s eating and nutrition. To some degree babies have reflux and will spit. This is especially true for preemies. BUT, it becomes an issue if 1.) They’re in pain when they eat and 2.) They aren’t gaining weight. Bella checks both of these boxes.</p>

<p>I told her everything. How Bella projectile spits (she said that’s vomiting), she’s in pain when eating, we can’t put her down without her throwing up, and we have concern she’s aspirating since she can’t take formula by mouth because of silent aspiration. It&#8217;s getting worse by the day and it&#8217;s almost a given she&#8217;ll throw up after a feed now.</p>
<p>She said we have lots of options still and not to be discouraged. To begin, we will rule out any anatomical issues, organ function issues, and things such as cancer. From there we can continue to run tests and try other things. She even mentioned a GJ tube (another version of a Gtube that also goes into the intestine), crazy specific $$$ formulas, and continuous feeds. She certainly thought it was more than just reflux.</p>
<p>I, of course, am very scared of cancer. Liver cancer is one of the most common forms of pediatric cancer and a low birth weight is a risk factor. The Dr. explained that the liver ultrasound (which we had done last week to rule out internal hemangiomas, but had a secondary finding on her liver) probably was just referring to her prematurity and that she had good tone, wasn’t jaundiced, and was peeing and pooping. These are all reasons to rule out cancer. This made me feel much better. We will still do blood work, but it’s highly unlikely. (Update: Blood work was normal!!!)</p>
<h2>Tiny Baby, Big Upper GI Scan</h2>
<p><figure id="attachment_2165" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165" style="width: 436px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9186-2-e1533086881345.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2165" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9186-2-e1533086881345-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="436" height="581" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9186-2-e1533086881345-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9186-2-e1533086881345-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9186-2-e1533086881345-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2165" class="wp-caption-text">Isabella being goofy and having fun before testing</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>So, after meeting with her, we called down to radiology and scheduled an Upper GI scan and blood work. Poor Bella was already hungry and tired. The GI scan wasn’t terrible, but it was quite scary seeing such a tiny baby in a massive adult sized machine. I should&#8217;ve brought my phone to catch a picture, but I was pretty occupied carrying Bella and making sure she was comfortable. They pushed barium through her gtube extension and 3 techs positioned her in different ways during imaging. She wasn’t happy and cried and fussed. I tried to talk to her and get her to calm down but she was just frustrated. It didn’t help that one of the techs didn’t realize her birthmark was sore and bumped it, making her cry, on accident. Many people get confused as to why Bella can’t be soothes with a pacifier. She will gag and throw up. Some don’t listen to me and try to “offer a gloved finger” to soothe her. She freaks out. I’m glad this tech listened and respected that she only likes sucking on her own fingers. She calmed down!</p>
<h2>Blood Work and Many Tears</h2>
<p><figure id="attachment_2168" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168" style="width: 337px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9191-2-e1533086721807.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2168" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9191-2-e1533086721807-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="337" height="449" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9191-2-e1533086721807-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9191-2-e1533086721807-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9191-2-e1533086721807-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2168" class="wp-caption-text">We ran out of cute coordinating outfits since she threw up on all of them. This is after her blood work.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Right afterwards my mom and I decided to take her across the hospital to get her blood work done. It was best that she hadn’t eaten so she wouldn’t throw up and choke while getting stuck. I wasn’t too anxious about it &#8230;.until we went in. Since they needed a bigger sample, they couldn’t do a heel poke. Instead, she had to get a big needle in her tiny arm. The one lady looked at me and said “this job is hard on the heart.” Tell me about it! Bella was so happy and cute until they tightened the rubber band around her little arm. She squealed and tried to get away. All three of us had to work together. I placed my forehead up to hers and talked to her and prayed. The needle was very big and she screamed and screamed. My hands were sweaty and both women were having a hard time, too.</p>
<p>Eventually, one of the ladies muttered that the blood wouldn’t come out.  it was the worst thing I could hear. We released the rubber band tourniquet and Bella took a breather. I began crying as they moved her tiny body around facing a new direction and inserted a new needle after using another tight rubber band. This time Bella screamed even louder. Gasping and kicking. I’m crying pretty hard at this point.</p>
<p>As they&#8217;re doing this, I think: No parent should ever have to experience this. No parent should ever have to wait for a call to rule out cancer or tumors or liver issues or brain bleeds, or traumatic brain injuries. Yet, we’ve been there. And we’re here.</p>
<p>I wanted to check out. I wanted to walk out. BUT, I’m her lifeline. I’m her steady. I’m her mom. I wiped back the tears and continued to cheer her on. Oh what a warrior! Oh what a brave baby girl! I was so proud to know her in this moment. So proud to have carried her. So proud.</p>
<p>We pushed through the final bit and they began wrapping her arms in bright yellow gauze with bumble bees on it. How strange, I thought. That they’d pick an animal that stings?! Isabella laid so still I thought she may have passed out. Nope, just exhausted from fighting the pain. Her little body was so limp as I scooped her up off the table and held her to my chest, careful not to rub her newly placed gtube (oh yes, we had an ER visit after her tube fell out last Thursday) or painfully sore arms. I walked out of there and into the lobby. My mom was sitting and looked up. She could hear Bella screaming the entire time. She said she’d never heard her scream like that.</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>I’m praying this will be the last time.</p>
<p>So, today, we’re waiting to hear from the doctor. I feel peace and think the tests will be OK and that we’ll just be battling some reflux or food intolerance. There’s a slight possibility we could be hearing some of the scariest news of our lives. Or maybe somewhere in between the two. Perhaps she needs another surgery? I grab my stomach as it drops. Not another surgery. Yet, there are some who would dream of only having two on their record. And there are some who pray every day that a surgery could give them one more day with their child.</p>

One more outfit change left.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I struggle. I’m not perfect. I want Bella well. I’m sick of being scared. But I try to refocus on God and his grace and his promises. You see, he loves this little girl even more than I. He cries when she cries. he hurts when she hurts. He’s here and He knows what those test results are. Thank you for reading and being there with us in the trenches.</p>

<p>Isabella was born without any birthmarks, but, after a few weeks we noticed a small, flat, red spot on her head. The NICU team assumed it was agitation from her CPAP hat so we switched her breathing assistance to give it a break from rubbing. After looking closely, her primary nurse and I determined it didn&#8217;t look like skin breakdown but more of a permanent spot. She threw out the thought, &#8220;oh she&#8217;s probably got a hemangioma!&#8221; I, of course was terrified looking up images (after learning to say/spell it).</p>
<p>My worst assumption ended up coming to fruition, Bella has a large hemangioma that looks every bit as scary as some of the ones I saw with my search. Simply put, it&#8217;s harmless, is considered a vascular birthmark, should go away as she grows, and is a collection of blood vessels. We did an MRI to rule out any issues and it&#8217;s completely superficial and cosmetic. Long story short, we choose not to treat it a few months ago. We got a second option from a pediatric dermatologist and heard from many neonatologists who treated Bella. We felt that was the right decision and that we would embrace it until things needed addressed. Until&#8230;</p>

<h2>Why is her birthmark a problem?</h2>
<p>Sadly, after being readmitted to the NICU we noticed 3 more teeny red dots/beginning of hemangiomas on her tummy/chest. They are elevating but don&#8217;t look scary yet. We were advised to follow up with dermatology to reconsider treatment. When there are 5, it&#8217;s recommended to begin treatment because there&#8217;s higher risk of internal ones. Internal ones can cause issues with major organs. The large one on her head is also growing rapidly. So, we were waiting for August 9th for her appointment when we noticed the birthmark changing color. I knew these things could ulcerate (skin breakdown), but hadn&#8217;t seen signs before. I&#8217;m so glad I trusted my intuition. I immediately contacted our dermatologist who confirmed with images it is beginning to ulcerate. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f641.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We began treating it with antibiotic cream and see him on Monday. (He offered the next day but we felt Bella needed to rest after going through so much). He said ulceration could be extremely painful. I&#8217;ve seen what they look like when they break down and it&#8217;s very painful looking.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s next? Isn&#8217;t it an easy fix?</h2>
<p>We will begin treatment with a drug called propranolol. This medication inhibits the growth of blood vessels and constricts current ones. This is hard for us as Bella is the size of a newborn (7lbs 12 ounces) and the thought of messing with her blood pressure/cardiovascular system terrifies us. That being said, with monitoring her blood pressure and vitals this treatment is safe and effective. It&#8217;s very commonly used. We don&#8217;t want the ulceration to get worse and we certainly don&#8217;t want to worry about internal hemangiomas!</p>

<p>I, personally would also like to prevent the others from getting to the size of her larger one. Since they&#8217;re on her chest/stomach they could interfere with her tummy time or gtube. After talking to the doctor, we decided to do a liver ultrasound just to confirm there aren&#8217;t any hemangiomas there. So, on Monday we&#8217;ll be trekking to Akron Children&#8217;s for her appointment and ultrasound.</p>

<p>Please pray</p>
<p>1.) This birthmark doesn&#8217;t ulcerate any further and that with treatment we can avoid pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>2.) Bella tolerates the medication.</p>
<p>3.) That we would be able to handle the magnitude of treating such a little one with such a serious prescription. That we would be extra careful with doses and track it well.</p>
<p>4.) Also, pray against any internal hemangiomas. We have no reason to believe she has any, but it is a possibility.</p>
<p>XOXO, Tiffany</p>
