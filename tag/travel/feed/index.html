<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After eating our full at Figlmullers, we took a double decker bus around the city for a break on our feet. We sat on the top and just took in the sites. There were headphones and you could hear Mozart and other famous musicians from Vienna playing music. I learned so much just from that tour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dad had us get off at Schonbrunn Palace. Although we didn’t go in, we walked around and looked in the windows. We also walked around the gardens. There was a coffee shop at the very top of a large hill. Although my feet were so achy, we climbed up and enjoyed a drink up there. The scenery was beautiful and I can’t imagine how it looks with flowers! I had never been to a real palace before, so this was really neat. Wikipedia says, </span><b>Schönbrunn Palace</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a former </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">imperial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> summer residence located in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vienna</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The 1,441-room </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baroque</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> palace is one of the most important architectural, cultural, and historical monuments in the country. Since the mid-1950s it has been a major tourist attraction. The history of the palace and its vast gardens spans over 300 years, reflecting the changing tastes, interests, and aspirations of successive </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Habsburg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Habsburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> monarchs.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What really stood out to me is that Mozart played there and essentially began his career there. His family traveled three weeks so he could play for the imperial family and he was only six years old.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After exploring the palace, we got back on the bus and toured the rest of the city. I felt like we got to see so much on the bus because on foot, it was difficult to see a lot. We learned that Vienna has the oldest zoo in the world and it began in 1752. We also saw the Vienna Armory, although we didn’t go inside. Dad did have us jump off for the breathtaking Belvedere Complex. The pictures we took in front of it were fantastic and it looks brilliant reflected in the water. Wikipedia says, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>Belvedere</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a historic building complex in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vienna</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, consisting of two </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baroque</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> palaces (the Upper and Lower Belvedere), the Orangery, and the Palace Stables. The buildings are set in a Baroque park landscape in the third district of the city, on the south-eastern edge of its centre. It houses the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96sterreichische_Galerie_Belvedere?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belvedere museum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The grounds are set on a gentle gradient and include decorative tiered fountains and cascades, Baroque sculptures, and majestic wrought iron gates. The Baroque palace complex was built as a summer residence for Prince </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_of_Savoy?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene of Savoy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Belvedere was built during a period of extensive construction in Vienna, which at the time was both the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Austria?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">imperial capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and home to the ruling </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Habsburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dynasty. This period of prosperity followed on from the commander-in-chief Prince Eugene of Savoy&#8217;s successful conclusion of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Ottoman_Wars?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a series of wars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ottoman Empire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other places we stopped at included an underground food court where we tried different foods and shopped. This underground space connected to the subway and also was below the Vienna Operahouse. I had to go to the bathroom. There was a very interesting bathroom called the Opera Toilet. You pay to go in and literally listen to classical music while you do your thing. The space is decorated like an opera and there was a mirror on the inside of the bathroom stall to take a commemorative picture. (I did). Some of the souvenirs we picked up included coffee liqueur, chocolate truffles, magnets, and a little music box that played Mozart. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next morning, dad woke up up with coffee from McDonalds. I usually stick my nose up at coffee from Mc’Ds, but this was fabulous! He hurried us along as we got ready to explore Vienna. Good walking shoes? Check. Water? Check. Snacks? We were prepared. Across the street from our hotel was a bright green city train. The train went back and forth between the city and airport. It was a double decker train with comfy seats and flat screen TVs with the news and other local information. On our way to Vienna, the countryside looked a lot like the United States. There were a lot of industrial buildings. Nothing extraordinary. We went underground and got off in a mall. It was a strange place for a city train! The mall was vacant since it was a Sunday. What shocked me the most was that the mall had a fresh produce store inside. How strange! Once we walked outside, I was in shock. The beauty of the city surrounded us. Ancient buildings, stunning architecture. Every turn was a photo moment. Dad knew exactly where to take us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We walked, trying not to run into people from looking up. The stores were delicately placed on a vertical slant and the roads were laid with cobblestone. Small storefronts looked too beautiful to hold a function. Cafes, oh there were so many quaint and cozy cafes! My camera didn’t stop taking photos. Jutka had us enter a cute chocolate shop. She explained there was a famous chocolate cake from Vienna we should try. It was called Sachertorte. This specialty is served in Vienna and a chocolate sponge cake. What impressed me was the beautiful little emblem on top. Even things you eat were beautiful here! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We put it aside and went to Figlmullers, a restaurant that specializes in Vienna cuisine. Dad made reservations for us in this tiny, narrow restaurant. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we waited to eat, dad and Jutka led us to the center of town. I hadn’t ever seen anything so epic in real life as St. Stephen’s Cathedral. Wikipedia says this: “</span><b>St. Stephen&#8217;s Cathedral</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Church#Cathedral?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mother church</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Vienna?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the seat of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Vienna?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archbishop of Vienna</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Cardinal_Sch%C3%B6nborn?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christoph Cardinal Schönborn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Praedicatorum?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other special places we saw included the Column of Pest (Column of The Trinity), which is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">late 17th-century sculpted Holy Trinity column, built to commemorate victims of the plague. Dad also had us walk and observe a Catholic Mass at another smaller beautiful church. At this point, we also tasted the Sachertorte, or chocolate cake. It was so so rich! I took a quick picture of it and only took a bite. It was almost too rich for me (if that’s possible). It really liked it, but with all the other food we were trying, only enjoyed a bit. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once our table was ready, we sat down in Figlmullers. This little restaurant is world famous for their schnitzel. Schnitzel is meat flattened out and then deep fried in a breading. The traditional Vienna Schnitzel is made with veal. The dish doesn’t even fit on a plate! We also ordered fries to share. I didn’t get the veal and instead opted for the Chicken Cordon Bleu which had chicken, ham, and swiss cheese. It was absolutely amazing. In fact, Dustin and I tried to go back a week later but they were full. </span></p>

<p>After eating our full, we took a double decker bus around the city for a break on our feet. We sat on the top and just took in the sites. There were headphones and you could hear Mozart and other famous musicians from Vienna playing music. I learned so much just from that tour.</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>

<p>Montgomery&#8217;s Take On Europe (Not Before Age 25, But Before 27)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the craziness of the holidays, on January 28th of 2016 we drove to Detroit. On our way, we stopped at Chili&#8217;s and enjoyed a nice dinner. The drive was relaxing, even though there was a little bit of traffic. We laughed and listened to music and prepped to explore Europe! We stayed at the Hampton Inn near the airport because it came with free breakfast and a shuttle to the airport. </span></p>

<p>January 29th: After sleeping in and relaxing, we grabbed waffles at breakfast. We spent as much time as possible at the hotel because our flight didn’t leave until the evening. After a bit, we took the shuttle to Detroit Airport. After getting through customs, I went shopping at the duty-free store. I had forgotten all of my eyeshadows! Eek! I bought a few things from MAC. We also decided to indulge in PF Changs in the airport. I, of course, excitedly told our waiter we were headed to Europe for the first time! Filled with excitement, we finally got aboard the plane. Soon after takeoff we were given our first meal&#8230;pasta! I made sure to wear leggings and a slouchy sweater. Dustin wore comfy jeans, a T, and a new zip-up hoodie. The food was good, and the movies were even better. Our eyes got BIG when we saw all of the new movies we could watch. We quickly decided NOT to watch movies together and instead indulged separately. There’s this picture of Dust holding the free eye mask and earplugs that cracks me up. Free things are so fun! I watched Brave, a Disney movie, and Dustin watched Jurassic World.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we woke up at <a href="http://www.parkvista.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Park Vista</a> in Gatlinburg on Sunday, June 5th,  we decided to head down to the awesome pool! There is a big waterslide and two different tiers to the pool. (My little sister stayed here on her honeymoon!) The entire space is held in a large open-window building and it&#8217;s very warm in there. It&#8217;s one of my favorite pools to go when in the Smokies.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1354" style="width: 677px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dh_pool2_3_677x380_FitToBoxSmallDimension_Center.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-1354 size-full" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dh_pool2_3_677x380_FitToBoxSmallDimension_Center.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="dh_pool2_3_677x380_FitToBoxSmallDimension_Center" width="677" height="380" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dh_pool2_3_677x380_FitToBoxSmallDimension_Center.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 677w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dh_pool2_3_677x380_FitToBoxSmallDimension_Center-300x168.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dh_pool2_3_677x380_FitToBoxSmallDimension_Center-30x17.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo Credit: DoubleTree</figcaption></figure>
<p>When no one was looking we took turns going down on the waterslide our stomachs and laughing a lot. It was a pretty fast slide. Afterwards, we ran back to the room, got ready, and were on our way.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1226" style="width: 768px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6465-e1468804348797.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-large wp-image-1226" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6465-e1468804348797-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="Fireflies at The Park Vista, Photo Cred: Gatlinburg.com" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6465-e1468804348797-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6465-e1468804348797-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6465-e1468804348797-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6465-e1468804348797-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6465-e1468804348797.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fireflies at The Park Vista, Photo Cred: Gatlinburg.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of heading straight to our bed and breakfast in Waynesville, North Carolina, we drove down the hill and hit the main strip in <a href="http://www.gatlinburg.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Gatlinburg</a>. There are all different types of shops and quirky attractions.</p>
<h5>Dustin described it as a weird fair that happens all year long.</h5>
<p>Gatlinburg is one of those places that you either love or hate. I&#8217;ve been coming here since I was an itty bitty girl so I have fond memories here. We vacationed a lot in the area around with both sets of my grandparents. I love the odd shops like the Beef Jerky outlet and Ripley&#8217;s Believe It Or Not Museum. It also doesn&#8217;t hurt that the scenery is beautiful.</p>

<h1>The Donut Friar, Gatlinburg, Tennessee</h1>
<p>It was raining. That put a damper on our day. Most of the shopping is outside. So we ate at Subway and then walked around to the different shops. I insisted we stop at <a href="http://www.thevillageshops.com/donutfriar.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Donut Friar</a>. This shop has THE BEST donuts in the world. Dustin later said he wasn&#8217;t impressed.</p>
<h5>I almost murdered him.</h5>
<p>He got to eat much more than I did. I only had a little bite because of my new diet.</p>
<p>Each donut is made fresh in the morning and the little shop is located in <a href="http://www.thevillageshops.com/donutfriar.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Village</a>. There is also a lovely coffee shop right down the way but the line was too long and we had to get going.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1228" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6468" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>Dino approves.</p>
<p>Other places we visited included random shops,<a href="http://www.bootleggerswine.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"> bootleggers homemade wine shop</a>,  and <a href="http://olesmoky.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">the moonshine distillery</a>. Both offer free samples, which is really neat. We don&#8217;t drink a lot, but don&#8217;t mind having a try while on vacation. Our favorite was the Strawberry Wine and Java Moonshine! I also bought a bright pink sweatshirt for $10 that says &#8220;Gatlinburg.&#8221; Dustin thought it looked kinda silly because it was so bright but I loved it!</p>
<h1>Clingman&#8217;s Dome, Great Smokey Mountains National Park</h1>
<p>With the donut as our energy (JK, we actually ate a healthy lunch), we drove up to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/clingmansdome.htm?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Clingman&#8217;s Dome</a>. This is part of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park and is located at the top of a mountain. You drive up the mountain and then go on a narrow road. At the top there is a small visitor&#8217;s center, port-a-pots, and a 1/2 mile hike to the top. On this day, it was very rainy and foggy. In fact, when we got to the place to park we couldn&#8217;t even see out. I remembered coming here as a girl and it was really awesome. Unfortunately we didn&#8217;t get a peek at the sights the entire time.</p>
<p>Even though it was sleeting we decided to hike to the top. It was only 1/2 mile so it couldn&#8217;t be hard, right? Oh my! It was a challenge. It was straight up the entire time. My legs were very tired and I had to stop a few times. It was frustrating because I&#8217;ve been working out and trying to get in shape. But, we made it to the top and it didn&#8217;t take too long, just a few short breaks.</p>

<p>The dome itself is pretty neat. Once you&#8217;re at the top you&#8217;re supposed to be able to see over 100 miles on a good day. For us, we could only see a few feet. It was foggy and cold. We still enjoyed the physical challenge though&#8230;and met some Christians who were climbing to the top to praise Jesus. That was really cool. We got back in the car and went on our way to Waynesville, North Carolina which took us about an hour and a half from Gatlinburg.</p>
<h1>The Yellow House Bed and Breakfast, Waynesville, North Carolina</h1>
<p>We arrived at <a href="http://www.theyellowhouse.com/index.htm?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Yellow House</a> at about 4:00pm. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/two-nights-at-the-yellow-house-on-plott-creek-road/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Last year we found this adorable bed and breakfast on Groupon</a>. We saw they were having another deal so we bought another. The stay was $200 for two nights. It was a steal!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1229" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6470" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>Shawn, the host, showed us to our room which was located inside the main house. Last year when we stayed we stayed in a separate suite by the upper pond. (<a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/two-nights-at-the-yellow-house-on-plott-creek-road/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">CLICK HERE</a> to see our trip last year.) The room we had picked this time was the Montecito. The room was lovely. The bed was super cozy and I loved the decor.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1255" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6544" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>I liked that the room had charm but felt modern and super neat. The room was located on the second floor. Like last year, Shawn showed us around and made sure we knew where the snacks in the butler&#8217;s pantry were. Dustin made sure to get lots of fresh cookies. I wasn&#8217;t feeling too great and neither was Dustin when we arrived. We had some snacks at the wine and cheese reception but then headed back to our room. Surprisingly, we stayed in the room the entire night. I had thought we&#8217;d go to <a href="http://sweetonionrestaurant.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Sweet Onion</a>, a restaurant I loved from last time, but it was closed since it was a Sunday.</p>

<p>I took a bath and put on one of their cozy robes. We ate some food we brought in the room and also had some snacks that were free. The mini fridge was stocked with drinks, which was a nice touch. I loved the included bath salts which smell so heavenly. Some of the games we played were Chinese Checkers and 3/13.</p>

<p>In the evening we turned on the fireplace. I loved sitting in the big overstuffed floral chair and reading. So did Dustin. Our room also had a coffee maker so we made some tea for me and coffee for him. It was very relaxing and cozy.</p>
<h5>I think we were both shocked when we went to bed at 10:30pm! (There are no TV&#8217;s in the rooms. There is wifi, but you&#8217;re encouraged to just connect with others).</h5>
<p>Another cool aspect of the room was that there was music playing through a sound system that&#8217;s wired throughout the house. You can turn it off or up/down. I liked the jazz and classical sounds. It made the experience feel extra special. We had our own private bath and toilet which was nice as well.</p>

<p>Our room was rounded and there were windows all around the bed. You can see in this image where the room was:</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6569.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1271" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6569-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6569" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6569-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6569-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6569-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6569-30x23.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Our bed was between the three windows in the back which are poking out. It was adorable. The next morning we awoke for breakfast on the patio and a full day in Asheville!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiff</p>

<p>It was Saturday, June 4th, and we&#8217;d already done so much! After <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/big-green-dinosaur-sunsphere-goats-on-the-roof/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">feeding goats on the roof </a>(literally), we decided it was time for us to eat!</p>
<h1>The Old Mill Restaurant &amp; Shops, Pigeon Forge, Tennessee</h1>
<p>One of our all-time favorite places to eat is The Old Mill Restaurant in Pigeon Forge. The portions are massive and the food is so delicious. There are also a lot of shops and things to do before eating. We went into the shops at the Old Mill Square. <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/info/farmhouse-kitchen?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Farmhouse Kitchen</a> was adorable and there were lots of samples to try. We purchased some sparkling cider and some chip dip for Dustin&#8217;s parents who were graciously watching our kitties while we were away.</p>
<p>I was super excited to go into <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/info/sassafras?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Sassafras</a>. The shop was in a little corner and had some adorable jewelry. In the back, everything was an extra 50% off. I picked up both a necklace and a bracelet for under $10. There were lots of opportunities to try different olive oils and we snacked and snacked, tasting different combinations.</p>

<p>One of the neater stores we walked into was the <a href="http://www.randalloglegallery.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Randall Ogle Gallery.</a> Inside there were some beautiful paintings. The man there was Randall himself. We were able to talk to him and he told us more about Cades Cove and how to see a bear. His paintings were really peaceful. On the brochure I picked up it said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Smokey Mountain Heritage,&#8221; the focal point of native artist Randall Ogle&#8217;s work, depicts unique scenes of the Great Smokey Mountains. The largest collection of Cades Cove artwork in the area featuring the special edition series &#8220;Cades Cove, Yesteryear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once we had enough shopping, we grabbed a seat at <a href="http://www.old-mill.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Old Mill</a>. I hadn&#8217;t had cheese in a long time but ordered a small side of macaroni and cheese. Even though it was delicious, I regretted it later! The mashed potatoes, corn fritters, and green beans were to die for! It is truly a magnificent place. It was also the only time I allowed myself sweet tea on the trip. This was a hard decision for me, but I know it was a good one. Sweet tea has too much sugar in it!</p>
<h1>The Park Vista by Doubletree, Gatlinburg, Tennessee</h1>

<p>Our room at The Park Vista was really nice. As a <a href="http://hhonors3.hilton.com/en/index.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Hilton Honors member</a> we got free bottles water and a mountain view upgrade. They also had us draw a prize out of a bowl. We won a coupon for a free appetizer at the hotel&#8217;s bar or restaurant.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1225" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6463" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6463-e1468371821989.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>The hotel itself is a large cylinder. When I was a little girl my parents brought me here. I remember dropping a Toy Story toy down the 15th floor that we got in a kids meal. It was of an army figure with a parachute on its back. We would race to see whose hit the ground first. It looked like this:</p>
<figure id="attachment_1325" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/51kZ8of1bhL.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-1325 size-full" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/51kZ8of1bhL.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="51kZ8of1bhL" width="500" height="386" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/51kZ8of1bhL.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 500w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/51kZ8of1bhL-300x232.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/51kZ8of1bhL-30x23.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo Credit: Amazon</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, the hotel is owned by Hilton and has been remodeled. It&#8217;s up on a mountain and offers great views. The pool is also pretty fabulous. They have a nice waterslide that we went on a lot the next morning.</p>
<h1>Cades Cove, Great Smokey Mountains National Park</h1>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1214" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6421" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6421-30x23.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the hotel was so full (at 5pm) that we weren&#8217;t able to check-in to our room. This was super sad since it was a pretty pricey hotel room for one night. We shrugged and decided to head to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/cadescove.htm?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Cades Cove</a> since it was raining. Cades Cove is outside of Gatlinburg and is part of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. It&#8217;s a looonnnnggg drive. It took us over an hour to get back to the park.</p>
<p>Was it worth it? Yes. Because BEARS.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1218" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447-1024x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6447" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447-1024x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447-150x150.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 150w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447-300x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447-768x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447-30x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447-200x200.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 200w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6447.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>I prayed and prayed we would see a bear. I&#8217;d heard of others driving back and not seeing one and just seeing deer. I concluded that even if we didn&#8217;t see a bear it was a beautiful place (which it is)!</p>
<h4>It&#8217;s one of those untouched places in the world that makes you feel alive and free. The beauty was overwhelming.</h4>
<p>Lucky for us there had been rain. So, we got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">double rainbow.</a>  (A Full On Double Rainbow!) This was actually after we had already seen a bear. A young, adolescent bear, as Dustin would call him, pass in front of our car!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1213" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6419" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6419-30x23.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>What a beautiful sight! The Lord stays true to his promises!</p>
<p>We drove the 11 mile loop and ended up seeing not one, but two bears. The first was smaller, but went right in front of our car. We got out and got to see him very up close!</p>

<p>We drove and saw ponies, turkey, and lots of dear. The wild turkey were pretty funny to watch as the moved their heads around in the grass. Later, we got to see a very large bear. This one I&#8217;d say was closer to 300+ pounds. He was further away, but we were on a hill and he was eating so we got to watch him well for over ten minutes. We actually left before he did!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s difficult to make him out, but I think you get the idea. There were others with massive lenses and professional cameras. We just used our phones and tried to live in the moment. Other things we did at Cades Cove included visiting some old cabins and an old church. We walked into the church out of the rain and explored. It was too dark to take pictures. The cabin was very cozy. It would&#8217;ve been a lovely sight to wake up to the mountains every morning. Below are pictures we took right in front of one of the original cabins.</p>

<p>On our way out of the park, we had to drive very carefully because wildlife could jump out in front of your car. This is an example:</p>

<p>I love how the deer is reflected in the water on the road which was left over after it had rained. The smoke on the mountains was so beautiful. This is probably one of the best pictures I&#8217;ve taken with my iPhone! I made sure you could see our dash so you could tell we were indeed driving!</p>
<p>If seeing 2 bears, a double rainbow, and other wildlife wasn&#8217;t enough, we ended up getting to see a momma bear and 2 cubs! On our way out of the park, I turned up some worship music and settled in for the long drive back. We came across lots of cars parked. There, in the forest, was a momma bear and two cubs. The lady beside me said they were the smallest cubs she&#8217;d ever seen and that they were probably very young. We couldn&#8217;t get a good picture, but it was a very special ending to our night. Praise the Lord and His beauty!</p>

<p>After Cades Cove we drove back to The Park Vista and checked in. We enjoyed the room and also went down to their bar for our free appetizer. There was a lovely outside patio, rocking chairs, and fire pit. The space was called <a href="http://www.parkvista.com/gatlinburg-restaurant-lounge.php?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Fireflies</a>. The hummus plate was really good and we sat around the fire.</p>

<p>Later, we decided not to swim but to enjoy the room and watch Cops. One of our favorite travel tv shows.</p>
<p>It had been a long day, but I was so happy we saw BEARS!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t have a good road trip without gas, right? Well, I thought this would be a great photo-op! A few years ago we got this fun silicone bean-stuffed dinosaur. We have no idea where we got it. Dustin says we may* have found him on the beach somewhere. We&#8217;re not sure. BUT we like to take him on trips as out travel mascot. I know it sounds funny and some people don&#8217;t get it, but it&#8217;s kind of a fun way to document our travels.</p>
<p>Meet Dino, the Awesome Travel Dude!</p>
<p>Above is Dustin getting gas for our trip. I had some writing to do so we left around 11am on Friday, June 3rd and headed from Mansfield to Caryville, Tennesee. Our first stop was Jungle Jims in Cincinnati, Ohio. Other stops included Lexington, Kentucky and Cumberland Falls, Kentucky.</p>
<h1>Jungle Jims, 1st Stop, Cincinnati, Ohio</h1>

<p>Oh, hey, there&#8217;s me! I had a writing interview this day with Neutrogena. I thought it was going to be a video call but ended up just being a phone conference. In this picture I was trying to mimic Hayden Panettiere&#8217;s makeup since she&#8217;s one of the faces of the brand. A lot of their products are simple and not over-pronounced. I really like the blue eyeliner I had on. The lip pencil was OK. I forget the shade but it was one of their brighter ones. Can you tell my skin is clearing up? Ever since I&#8217;ve started eating a plant-based whole food diet it&#8217;s gotten a lot better. Oh, and I&#8217;ve lost 25lbs.</p>

<p>It took us about 2 1/2 hrs to get to <a href="http://www.junglejims.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Jungle Jims</a> from our house. This place is ah-mazing. If you love food and love traveling this is the place to shop. I would drive there just to spend the day. It&#8217;s a MASSIVE grocery store with foods from all over the world. My mum first told us about it and said they had $5,000+ bottles of wine. I didn&#8217;t get it&#8230;until I went for the first time. It&#8217;s seriously almost like an amusement park. They also give out free samples. It&#8217;s hard for me since I&#8217;m vegan, but they had some I could try.</p>

<p>Outside there are animal noises and a really cool looking elevated train. You can&#8217;t ride it, it&#8217;s just for looks. Once you walk inside you&#8217;re overwhelmed with the size. The store even gives tours. We came at a random time but there were still lots of samples out. We had to limit our time or else we wouldn&#8217;t make it anywhere else this day.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a fun hippie theme in one section of the store. I told Dustin to stand for a picture. I think this was in the all natural section. The air steam painted trailer, picture of John Lennon, and tie dye clothes were perfect. We didn&#8217;t buy a lot since we were watching our money and brought out own meals. Things aren&#8217;t much more expensive than regular stores here. We bought some <a href="http://www.manner.com/en/original-neapolitan-wafers?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">wafers (Manner)</a> that we liked from Austria, some vinegar flavored edible crickets, a weird drink for Dustin, and some Italian pasta and sauce that we tried. The pasta sauce was from <a href="https://www.bongiovibrand.com/about.php?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Bon Jovi&#8217;s dad</a>. It was a garden marinara and it was excellent. The free sample got us hooked and we bought the $7 sauce and $2 pasta. Later, we made it at my grandparent&#8217;s cabin. It was so good! I later realized it had butter in it. A no no on my diet (and my stomach). Bummer.</p>
<p>PS- Go into the bathrooms. They look like porta pots on the outside but are really nice modern bathrooms on the inside. Mind = Blown!</p>

<p>Dustin and I also found <a href="https://www.rightfoods.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Dr McDougall foods</a>! This is the brand that started me on my whole foods plant-based diet. I love the food and now I&#8217;m vegan and feeling the best I&#8217;ve felt in years. I wanted a picture by the wall of the food to send to my family. Also, to keep track of my progress. One of my goals is to send my testimony to Dr. McDougall once I hit my goal weight!</p>

<p>There aren&#8217;t any words for this picture. Later, we sat in the car and tried a weird drink Dustin picked out. I took a video but forget where I put it. I hated it. The texture was weird. The basil seeds were slimy. I don&#8217;t think Dustin liked it because we dumped it out in Lexington, KY.</p>

<p>Last thing we did in Cinci was eat at Jimmy Johns. I only had eaten there once in Chicago and didn&#8217;t remember loving it. Well, we liked it a lot better this time. Maybe because we appreciate fresh food better. They had a vegan option for me too. I had a veggie sub with avocado and some kettle chips. The kettle chips were a splurge, but good!</p>
<h1>Mary Todd Lincoln&#8217;s House, 2nd Stop Lexington, Kentucky</h1>
<p>I had plans for us to stop at a neat little place called the <a href="http://www.rabbithash.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Rabbit Hash General Store</a>. This store is in Burlington, Kentucky and is one of the oldest general stores around. The town is known because they have dogs as their mayors whom the residents vote for each term. I wanted to stop by and catch a <del>glimpse </del>pet of the furry mayor. Unfortunately, as I read up on it and after we put in into the GPS we realized it burned down recently. So, we skipped it and kept heading to Lexington. Another stop we considered was The American Sign Museum in Cincinnati. This looked really cool but was $15pp and we wanted to hike more than look at signs so we saved it for another day since it&#8217;s closer to us.</p>

<p>Silly Dino selfie! Once we hit Lexington we were so excited to see all the cool rock &#8220;fences.&#8221; There were rocks stacked along the road and it looked so sophisticated. There were lots of horse stables (as to be expected) and charm. <a href="http://mtlhouse.org/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Mary Todd Lincoln&#8217;s home</a> was located right downtown. We parked beside the conference center and walked to it. It was closed, but we read all the information outside and got to see some of the other historic homes.</p>

<p>At this time, we were both needing to go to the restroom and needing some caffeine. Somehow I always notice when there&#8217;s a local coffee shop nearby. There was one near our car. <a href="http://dailyofferingscoffee.com/dailyofferings/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Daily Offerings Coffee Roastery </a>was across the street from the Hilton and smelled wonderful. I have been without coffee for close to two months but Dustin got an iced coffee and I got some of their orange black tea. It was delicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look, you look artsy and mysterious.&#8221;</p>
<p>While walking we walked by a cool interior design store. I had to capture this horse that was encrusted with jewels.</p>

<h1>Cumberland Falls, 3rd Stop, Corbin, Tennessee</h1>
<p>After Lexington, we kept driving to <a href="http://parks.ky.gov/parks/resortparks/cumberland-falls/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Cumberland Falls</a>. We went here last year with out families. My dad took me there before as well. It&#8217;s on the way and is a cool stop. It&#8217;s also known for its moonbeam.</p>
<p>Traffic was rough and that was frustrating because the clock was ticking. I didn&#8217;t want to get there when it was dark. We crept up to the lodge and put on our tennis shoes. After a quick bathroom break we hiked down to the falls. It was a two mile hike from <a href="http://www.2geton.net/martin/moonbow/dupont_lodge.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Du Pointe Lodge </a>there and back. It was pretty steep. I remembered last year doing it and hating it. This year it was hard, but not as difficult since I&#8217;ve been working out. Before, I didn&#8217;t dare climb the rocks at the bottom since I was so out of shape. This time we climbed up them at the base and had a snack.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1199" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379-819x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6379" width="819" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379-819x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 819w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379-240x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 240w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379-768x960.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379-24x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 24w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379-300x375.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6379.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></a></p>
<p>It was really special. Sitting there watching the falls as the darkness fell. We were the only ones there other than those fishing. I snacked on a banana and some granola. On our way back up the sun went down. It was darker but we made it up fine. I kept running into spider webs though. That part sucked. I&#8217;d like to go back and hike even further. Our hotel was in Caryville, Tennessee. We pulled in pretty late. Close to 9pm, maybe later. We took turns showering off from the hike and had some McDougall meals. We watched TV and went to bed right away!</p>

<p>Dustin&#8217;s tired! We drove about six hours and hiked. I&#8217;d call that a good first day!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>
<p>PS- I used the Roadtrippers Ap which is free on my Iphone to find stops along the way. I planned it out ahead of time!</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember I&#8217;ve wanted to travel and see the world. Perhaps it was my parents influence. Even though we lived in little Willard, Ohio, they always made it a point to take my sister and I to new and exciting places. Whether it was just a hotel stay in Sandusky thirty minutes away or the numerous trips we took to Florida as a family, the travel bug caught me.  One of my earliest memories traveling as a family is when my grandparents and parents took us on an RV tour. We got to see Gettysburg and <a href="http://www.chincoteague.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Chincoteague Island </a>(wild horses live here and even hang out on the beach). It was cramped and sometimes hard being cooped up, but I remember staying on an old battlefield that was turned into a campground. All of us huddled together in the small RV and watched a VCR tape of Misty of Chincoteague, the movie based off the children&#8217;s books.<br />

<p>While in college, I had made a list of 200 things to do before I died. Of course, time seemed infinite at 18 and I put some hefty goals on there. When I met my husband, <strong>I told him boldly I wanted to see the 7 wonders of the world before I turned 25.</strong> Well, real life happened after we got married and travel seemed&#8230;expensive. We&#8217;ve done as much as we can and have gotten to see some really cool budget friendly places (Mexican Riviera, Niagara Falls, Las Vegas) BUT we hadn&#8217;t yet made it to Europe&#8230;until this year!</p>

<p>My dad is in international business and fell in love with a woman from Hungary. To be honest, at the time we were working on renovating our cozy cottage here in Mansfield, Ohio and trying to launch our own business. International travel wasn&#8217;t really on the radar for a long time (or so we thought). Dad and his bride became engaged and quickly and wanted to have a wedding in Hungary. So, my dad offered to use his frequent flier miles and own funds for us to come and visit. It was one of the most magnificent things I&#8217;ve ever done. Now, we just scheme how to get back over there again and see more interesting places.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been awhile since I&#8217;ve revisited and finished writing about our southern road trip that we took at the beginning of this cram-packed summer. If you forget all we did or want a recap, check out my <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/a-southern-road-trip/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">overview post</a>, which links to each day individually.</p>
<h4>If you&#8217;re here just to see awesome pictures of our biplane ride, keep scrolling!</h4>
<p>Sunday, May 31st we left <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/two-nights-at-the-yellow-house-on-plott-creek-road/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Yellow House</a>, a quaint bed and breakfast in North Carolina and headed back to Pigeon Forge for our last night on our road trip. As usual, I was looking over <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/a371a6e5-ba68-419b-8dae-d4fdaf10c876?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Groupon</a> and found a bunch of different things to do. The thing that kept hitting me was a biplane ride. Of course I talked Dustin into letting me buy us tickets. After a quick call to the pilot, we determined a time and drove to the Pigeon Forge airport.</p>
<h4><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-822" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="mainplanefirstpic" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></h4>
<p>The deal we purchased was $79 for a 15 minute biplane ride for two people. I called ahead to make sure we could redeem it that day and then purchased it with my debit card online. The owner, <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/knoxville/life/former-sailor-takes-to-the-sky-in-historic-biplane_95698627?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Marc Hightower</a>, (click on the link for a cool post about him) was welcoming and personable. He explained that business was slow and he decided to do a <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/a371a6e5-ba68-419b-8dae-d4fdaf10c876?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Groupon</a> to get more business and get his name out there.</p>

<p>In the short time we spent with him, we learned he had rebuilt this  1927 Waco Model 10 himself. It was fascinating to hear that he flies it from Key West every summer to offer rides in the Smokies. His life was just as interesting. He had lived on a boat, owned a postcard store, and currently lived in Key West. Marc took the pictures you see of us with the vintage plane. Don&#8217;t let the smile fool you&#8230;I was terrified!</p>

<p>We brought our camera to get lots of pictures in the air. Takeoff was simple and so was the landing. The thing that surprised me the most was how loud and windy it was. After awhile you became used to the noise and it became really cozy and relaxing. Honestly, I could see taking a nap while flying! Marc was nice enough to give us hair ties (yes, Dustin too) so that our hair didn&#8217;t get in knots.</p>

<p>We both had headsets on so we could hear Marc communicating with the other planes and the airport before lifting off. It was really interesting. Dustin&#8217;s had a microphone and mine didn&#8217;t. While in the air the pilot gave us a tour, explaining the different sites.</p>

<p>Taking the bi-plane ride was one of the coolest things we&#8217;ve done together. It was really neat that it was vintage and restored. Overall I&#8217;d say it was romantic and the perfect touch to end out trip down south. The next place we stayed at wasn&#8217;t a good experience. I&#8217;ll write about that next.</p>
<h3>Would you do a bi-plane ride? Have you?</h3>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>While staying at The Yellow House, we took all day Saturday, May 30th to explore Asheville, North Carolina. Unfortunately I had a lot of writing to do, so after we finished breakfast on the porch of the inn, we drove to a coffee shop in downtown Asheville.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wakinglifeespresso.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Waking Life Espresso</a> was exactly what we needed to get our work done while in the mountains. This little coffee shop is located in a remodeled house and is light filled and airy. In the front there are bar seats and in a smaller room in the back there are couches and a table. The coffee was no-frills and especially delicious. To see how serious they are about their coffee, watch this <a href="https://vimeo.com/103960232?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">video</a>.</p>
<p>I worked on my articles and Dustin just hung out. (Perhaps working? I&#8217;m not sure.) At about 2:00pm, we drove the ten minutes to <a href="http://www.biltmore.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Biltmore</a>, the main attraction for the day.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tiffinfrontofbiltmore.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-666" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tiffinfrontofbiltmore-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="tiffinfrontofbiltmore" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tiffinfrontofbiltmore.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tiffinfrontofbiltmore-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tiffinfrontofbiltmore-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tiffinfrontofbiltmore-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>When I was a little girl, I remember visiting The Biltmore. This mansion is known as the largest privately owned house in the United States. It&#8217;s interesting because Dustin had also been there with his parents when he was eighteen. We remembered bits and parts (like the indoor swimming pool) but wanted to go together. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/two-nights-at-the-yellow-house-on-plott-creek-road/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Yellow House</a> was about thirty minutes from Asheville, where The Biltmore is located.</p>

<p>The price tag was enough to shy us away, but we decided since we were close we should go. My love for interiors and art history really helped to sway the decision to drop the $120 ($60 per ticket) and spend the day there. I also used my vacation money to buy the tickets.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/biltmoredarkaway.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-636" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/biltmoredarkaway-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="biltmoredarkaway" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/biltmoredarkaway.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/biltmoredarkaway-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/biltmoredarkaway-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/biltmoredarkaway-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Words and pictures really don&#8217;t do this place justice. It took hours to tour and there was a room dedicated to arranging flowers. The Vanderbilt&#8217;s, who owned the home, were fascinating people who loved art and each other. An example of architecture from The Gilded Age, the mansion has <strong>252 rooms</strong>.</p>

<p>Pictures and videos are prohibited of the inside. George Vanderbilt shared a love for technology and entertaining guests. It was really interesting to see the parallels between the couple, George and Edith, and us. He loved technology and had electricity throughout the home and Edith loved books and taking care of guests.

<p>Dustin and I found ourselves staring on multiple occasions at the craziness of it all. The massive dining room had <strong>three fireplaces</strong> and there were separate rooms dedicated to guns, smoking, and games. I personally loved seeing the restored furniture and paintings by famous artists.</p>

<p>You can easily spend more than a day at The Biltmore. Along with the mansion, there is shopping, dining, a winery, hiking trails, gardens, and entertainment. There are hotels on site and even tours for taking horseback rides. We didn&#8217;t have enough time to see everything, but after going through the mansion we enjoyed the gardens for a bit. We drove over to Antler Hill Village where there were shops and a winery. While there, there was also live music in the center gazebo.</p>
<p>We brought our own snacks and got an appetizer at <a href="http://www.biltmore.com/visit/things-to-do/dining/cedrics-tavern?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Cedric&#8217;s Tavern</a> located at the <a href="http://www.biltmore.com/visit/village-winery?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Antler Hill Village</a>. We had hoped to eat dinner at Cedric&#8217;s, but after seeing the menu, nothing seemed that good. The place was over-priced. Since we were hungry and still had more to see, we ordered an appetizer. It was way too salty and not very good. After wasting $20 on an appetizer and water, we asked for our bill.</p>
<p>The winery wasn&#8217;t anything too special. We tried a few wines but didn&#8217;t like waiting in line. (Wine tasting is free with your ticket.) After buying a book about the mansion, we left to eat somewhere outside of the park.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a really neat experience. A $60 ticket only included admission to the mansion and property. The audio tour was an additional amount and there were other behind-the-scenes tours we didn&#8217;t take. I felt that the $60 ticket was fine for us. We saw plenty and I purchased a book to learn even more.</p>

<p>Dustin and I said we loved it, but wouldn&#8217;t go back anytime soon. <strong>It was one of those places that you go once and don&#8217;t need to keep going back.</strong> I would like to see it decorated for Christmas though. The property was very romantic.</p>

<p>In the future, we&#8217;d go back if we had kids. It&#8217;s one of those places that&#8217;s so out of this world, but very expensive. If you plan on going, eat ahead of time or bring snacks. We left and ate at an amazing place called The White Duck Taco.</p>

<p>While walking about, we acted like we owned the place. We laughed and told stories about our day to day lives as millionaires. It was fun to dream.</p>

<p>You could go and spend a day just going through the gardens. It felt like I was transported into the book <em>The Secret Garden</em>. It was hot and we were hungry so we only walked a short ways and drove the rest. I don&#8217;t usually suggest buying more than a one day ticket, but for The Biltmore, it would be worth it.</p>
<p>This stop on May, 30th was one of our favorite places on our Southern Road Trip. To see an overview of all we did on this vacation, <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/a-southern-road-trip/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">click here</a>!</p>

<p>When we went off on our own, we headed to <a href="http://www.theyellowhouse.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Yellow House On Plott Creek Road</a>. This little bed and breakfast is located in the charming town of Waynesville, North Carolina. I had heard of it through Groupon. For $299, you received a two-night stay in a suite, checking in on Friday. As usual, I read reviews before purchasing the deal and saw plenty of high ratings. The pictures looked fantastic. We left Starbucks and drove straight to the bed and breakfast in the rain. I hadn&#8217;t realized we were running a little late for check-in, so I called ahead and let the inn-keeper know. Shawn was extremely accommodating welcomed us at the door.</p>

<h3>Friday, May 29th: First Night at The Yellow House &amp; Dinner at The Sweet Onion</h3>
<p>As soon as we drove up, the air seemed to get lighter. There was a magical feeling about this place. It felt as if we had gone back in time. The yellow house overlooked a lot of greenery and you could see it from the road. The mountains in the background looked like someone had painted them. We heard a bunch of folks talking on the front porch and saw some plates and glasses of wine.</p>

<p>When we walked in, a man introduced himself as Shawn. He began whisking us around the old home, pointing out port wine, a pantry full of snacks, a cheese plate, and board games. <strong>It felt like we were coming back home to place we&#8217;d never been. </strong>There were about ten different people eating appetizers and visiting in the parlor and front porch. Shawn explained that it was their cheese and wine reception.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-623" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhousestaircase" width="678" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 678w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-768x1160.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousestaircase.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></a></p>
<p>The floor creaked below our feet and the china in the cabinets softly clinked as we walked into the butler pantry. Shawn told us to help ourselves to snack bars, cereal, fresh fruit, and cookies (he baked fresh every day). He showed us the hot water for tea and where we could leave our plates. There was also a room with books and lots of board games. Before taking us to our suite, which was located in another building, Shawn explained that the inn had plenty of material on the town and all the menus from local restaurants.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-621" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhouseparlor" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseparlor-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>I noticed the inn was clean and well appointed. It was cozy and worn but not stuffy. A large clock stood to the right and there was a buffet with port wine and small glasses. On the coffee table there were lots of different photo books dedicated to the bed and breakfast. My favorite was a day in the life of the inn&#8217;s cat. Shawn had made the book, telling the story of the inn from the resident cat&#8217;s perspective. Another book was filled with pictures of the inn during different seasons.</p>

<p>We followed Shawn up a small road to another building that housed our suite.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-600" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhouseviewofsuite" width="678" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 678w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-768x1160.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseviewofsuite.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></a></p>
<p>We booked the Kinsale Suite. It&#8217;s located in a small house overlooking the upper pond. Along with a front area with rocking chairs, the suite had a small porch in the back. I loved hearing the creek as we got out of our car and Shawn climbed out of his golf cart .</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-601" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhousewithcar" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousewithcar-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Once inside, I was surprised at how clean and cozy the space felt. Shawn showed us around, offering instructions on the double-sided fireplace and showing us how to close the built-in blinds. He also explained that the fridge was stocked with complimentary drinks and told us how the air-jetted tub worked. He told us he&#8217;d leave some cheese and crackers out a little bit longer and told us to hurry back to the house and eat. I sat some bags down and headed over.</p>
<p>The wine and cheese reception was great. Shawn had two different types of wine, china laid out, hummus, crackers, different cheeses, and snacks. We both grabbed some plates and a glass of wine. Sitting on the front porch, we took a deep breath and looked over the property. You could hear the birds chirping and glasses clinking. Some people were sitting inside, others at the outside sitting area. Afterwards, we looked around at the menus collected in a basket near the reception area. Shawn told us that there would be a wait since we didn&#8217;t have reservations. I laughed. We were in the middle of nowhere, how could there be a wait for dinner? After deciding on a place called The Sweet Onion, we went back to the suite to freshen up.</p>

<p>The Kinsale was ideal. The bed was extra comfy and I loved the unique art and furniture.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseroomfireplaceandbed.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-598" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseroomfireplaceandbed-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhouseroomfireplaceandbed" width="678" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseroomfireplaceandbed-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 678w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseroomfireplaceandbed-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseroomfireplaceandbed-768x1160.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseroomfireplaceandbed-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseroomfireplaceandbed-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhouseroomfireplaceandbed.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></a></p>
<p>We adjusted the individual thermostat and turned up the air conditioning. I looked around, inspecting the room. I loved the double-sided fireplace that could be enjoyed from the bed and bathtub.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousefireplaceinroom.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-593" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousefireplaceinroom-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhousefireplaceinroom" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousefireplaceinroom.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousefireplaceinroom-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousefireplaceinroom-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousefireplaceinroom-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The space was large, with two separate rooms and a bathroom with a walk-in shower. The tub was sparkling and had Yellow House branded bath salts beside it and soaps. I also noticed handmade mugs with the bed and breakfast&#8217;s logo on them by the coffee maker.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousefridgeandrobes.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-594" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousefridgeandrobes-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhousefridgeandrobes" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousefridgeandrobes.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousefridgeandrobes-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousefridgeandrobes-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousefridgeandrobes-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>There was an ice box, microwave, coffee maker, and fridge. Inside the fridge were bottled juices, sodas, and Perrier Sparkling Bottled Water. Coffee and tea was placed in a basket near a roll of paper towels. There were also extra cozy robes with the bed and breakfast&#8217;s logo on them hanging up. They smelled like fresh linen and were really soft to the touch.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousegardentub.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-595" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousegardentub-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="theyellowhousegardentub" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousegardentub.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousegardentub-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousegardentub-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/theyellowhousegardentub-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Another unique touch was a dark hand towel with the words &#8220;Make Up&#8221; embroidered onto it. The rest of the towels were white, so this was a good place to take off my red lipstick.</p>

<p>After freshening up, we drove to <a href="http://www.sweetonionrestaurant.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Sweet Onion</a>. Sure enough, Shawn had been right. There was a thirty minute wait for the Southern farm fresh restaurant. Downtown Waynesville, The Sweet Onion made me think of a New Age hippie that grew up in the South. There were waiters with cool tattoos serving up fresh fritters and fried chicken. Water was poured into mason jars and the place felt like a modern southern diner&#8230;only more pricey.</p>

<p>The food was phenomenal. I ordered chicken fingers with macaroni and cheese. Dustin had a chicken parmesan sandwich. We talked and talked and laughed. It was a wonderful meal. When we left, we decided to walk around the little town.</p>

<p>Waynesville is quaint. It reminds me of the town in the book/movie <em>The Notebook</em>. There are cute little shops with mountains as the backdrop. Even though it&#8217;s a country area, there are nice art shops and galleries. Everything was closed but the May air was hot. We walked and walked. There were a few bars and pizza joints open. I was surprised to see an old theater. <a href="http://www.38main.com/index.php/about-us?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Strand</a> is a boutique theater that offers free viewings of movies. It was late and we wanted to enjoy our room. If we weren&#8217;t tired we would have watched a movie and ordered some homemade sodas. There were lots of people walking dogs and we even looked in the window of a dog bakery. Sleepy, we headed back to the Yellow House amidst the mountains.</p>

<p>We walked to the Yellow House (a four minute walk) from our suite. Shawn had showed us the code to get in. Lights were low and people were talking upstairs. We sat in the parlor and drank small glasses of port wine. We talked about our dinner and moving to the mountains. After grabbing a board game, we headed back to our room. There were matches and small aromatic candles near the bath. I took a relaxing bath and we went to sleep early.</p>

<p>The next morning, we walked to the front porch for breakfast. Shawn asked us if we wanted to eat inside or outside. Of course we said outside. The weather and view was perfect! A few welcoming women waited on us and offered us juice and coffee. Shawn was walking around in an apron, visiting casually with other guests. I could smell the food.</p>

<p>The first morning we had the following: fruit cups with yogurt, bacon, peach french toast, and more fruit for dessert with powdered sugar. The peach french toast was delicious. Shawn handed out recipe cards. The next morning we had fruit, asparagus, tator tots, and ham spinach quiche.</p>

<p>The portion sizes were abundant. We were seated with another couple. After visiting, we realized we had a lot in common. This was their second time there using a Groupon and they had driven from Atlanta, Georgia. They were both Christians and we found that out from where the wife had gone to college (another conservative-Christian school). It was really nice to get to visit with other Christians. What a blessing! I wish I would&#8217;ve gotten their information. The husband was from Ecuador and had a strong accent. The wife had also lived in Chicago near Lincoln Square. We knew a lot of the same areas and subway stops. (We also had matching blue nail polish!)</p>

<p>That day, Saturday, May 30th,  we explored Asheville, North Carolina. Among the things we did was work at a coffee shop, visit the Biltmore, and eat at a local taco place. We left The Yellow House on Sunday, May 31st.</p>

<p>A few times we saw a black and white kitty lazying around the property. We walked around and enjoyed the outdoors. It was kept beautifully. There were lots of butterflies and other birds.</p>

<p>Dustin managed to find a hammock. He laid back and took a deep breath in. We were relaxed and wanted to stay a few more nights. While checking out, Shawn told us more about the area and also told us the brand of the port wine we sipped (Taylor Tawny Port). Before heading out, we played cards on the front porch.</p>

<p>It was such a lovely experience. The Groupon deal is gone but I&#8217;ve heard they have them occasionally. Even if you don&#8217;t have a Groupon it&#8217;s well worth it for the stay. You can read lots of reviews on <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g49648-d80701-Reviews-The_Yellow_House_on_Plott_Creek_Road-Waynesville_North_Carolina.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Tripadvisior</a>.

This bed and breakfast way by far one of the nicest we&#8217;ve visited. If you stay, tell Shawn we said hello!</p>
