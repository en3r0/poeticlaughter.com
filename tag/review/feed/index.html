</a></p>
<p>We just got back from Europe and the February <a href="https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/N3/ALL/beautybox_landing_save5.jsp?cds_page_id=195230&amp;cds_mag_code=ALL&amp;cds_response_key=S5ZA3AB6&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Allure Beauty Box</a> was waiting for me. I loved almost everything in it and still think it&#8217;s one of the best beauty boxes out there. Well, I was confused because a few days later this past Monday there was ANOTHER box at the door. I assumed it was March&#8217;s beauty box&#8230;until I did a quick search online. Other bloggers were saying that this box is a completely free bonus box! It&#8217;s called the <a href="http://www.mysubscriptionaddiction.com/2016/02/allure-beauty-box-red-carpet.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Allure Red Carpet Bonus Beauty Box</a>. I remembered entering a sweepstakes and didn&#8217;t realize I won. The box is valued at $88!</p>
<p>How Stinking Cool!</p>
<p>So, I began this blog post writing about what I thought was the March box to find out it was just a free, just-because box. Aren&#8217;t &#8216;just because&#8217; things the very best?</p>
<p>The box came with a mini magazine like usual and a lot of products. What caught my attention right away was Allure&#8217;s collaboration with Cover Girl. I&#8217;m not a big fan of Cover Girl, but the products included were full sized and were inspired by Katy Perry&#8217;s Grammy&#8217;s look.</p>
<p>As I was opening the box, I did find it strange that there wasn&#8217;t much variety, but I assumed that since the value of the full sized products was so high, it was a special box. I didn&#8217;t realize it was a freebie! There was no indicator on the box that it had been a bonus box.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what was included:</p>
<p>Covergirl Plumpify Blast Pro in Very Black, $8.99</p>
<p>Covergirl Tru Blend Primer for Combo Skin, $9.99</p>
<p>Covergirl Intensify Me! Liquid Eyeliner, $8.00</p>
<p>Covergirl Colorlicious Oh Sugar! Lip Balm in Candy, $8.99</p>
<p>SK-II Facial Treatment Essence, $33</p>
<p>SK-II Facial Treatment Mask, $17</p>
<p>Wella Oil Professionals Oil Reflections Smoothening Oil, $10</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sk-ii.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-SKII-Site/default/Home-Show?&amp;cm_mmc=PPC-IP-GGL-_-SKII_Search_Brand+Awareness.Exact-_-Brand_General_Exact-_-sk%20ii_mkwid_srEbg7smN_78590811431_sk%20ii_e_c&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQiAjMC2BRC34oGKqY27jtkBEiQAwSXzfnU90lj3gwvQsBRdmwLBF1y3P94869ep3VplY4WZaI8aAh5S8P8HAQ&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">SK-II</a> is a brand I&#8217;ve heard of but haven&#8217;t tried anything from. Some quick research on Sephora revealed that the brand is from Japan. Actresses like Cate Blanchett swear by their skin products. The box included two expensive items. (Oh, yea, that&#8217;s why I hadn&#8217;t tried it!) The first was the brand&#8217;s Facial Treatment Mask. The masks I usually buy at Sephora are about $8. This mask is a whopping $17! It&#8217;s supposed to be a part of wedding rituals. Sephora says,</p>
<p>&#8220;This 100 percent cotton mask drenches the skin with pitera’s fusion of vitamin, amino acids, minerals, and organic acids, while working to revitalize, comfort, and provide intense hydration. It immediately replenishes dehydrated skin, leaving it refreshed and cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other item included was <a href="http://www.sephora.com/search/search.jsp?keyword=essence&amp;ref=1360665&amp;defaultSortBy=-1&amp;pageSize=60&amp;browserdefault=true&amp;om_mmc=ppc-GG&amp;mkwid=szMT2P5wM&amp;pcrid=70118698972&amp;pdv=c&amp;site=us_search&amp;country_switch=us&amp;lang=en&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQiAjMC2BRC34oGKqY27jtkBEiQAwSXzfmoAqC7maY6mvsf2v7GO6BeBYQSy5Xp_jlaNfrBPPYYaAidR8P8HAQ&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">SK-II&#8217;s Facial Treatment Essence</a>. This product seems so ambiguous. What&#8217;s facial essence? Well, of course, I looked it up.</p>
<p>#1 it&#8217;s super expensive</p>
<p>#2 it looks just like good quality H2O</p>
<p>#3 it&#8217;s supposed to change your skin and be worth the price tag</p>
<p>Hmm. Sephora explains it like this</p>
<p>&#8220;Facial Treatment Essence is enriched with more than 90 percent Pitera—the main ingredient used to enhance the skin&#8217;s renewal process—plus nourishing vitamins, amino acids, minerals, and organic acids to promote a healthy skin cell renewal cycle. With daily application, this essence moisturizes, improves texture and clarity, and contributes to a more beautiful, balanced, and glowing complexion. &#8221;</p>
<p>We shall see. I haven&#8217;t tried either.</p>
<p>The other product that wasn&#8217;t Covergirl was the Wella Oil. I rolled my eyes when I saw this product. Another hair oil? You bet! I have enough to bathe in twice a day for a year. Ok, ok ok. This product does work. I did drop $40 with Birchbox points for Bumble and Bumble&#8217;s Hairdresser&#8217;s Oil, but this stuff seems to work just as well and it smells delicious. All you need is a small drop in the palm of your hands and it smooths out every frizz on your head. I think this will last me a very long time since you don&#8217;t need a lot. The size that was included was one ounce which is worth about $10.</p>

<p>The rest of the products included in this fabulous free box were from Covergirl. The mini magazine included a picture of Katy Perry from the Grammy&#8217;s. The products are supposed to be products she used for her look.</p>
<p>I really love the picture of her!</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;ve gotten the box, I&#8217;ve had a chance to try all the Covergirl products! Some I liked and others I&#8217;m not sure about.</p>
<p>The Intensify Me! eyeliner is interesting. It&#8217;s a liquid eyeliner, but it has a paddle-shaped applicator. I liked how pigmented it was but I found it difficult to apply. Now, it may just take some practice. I did notice the shape made cat eyes pretty easy to achieve. Again, this product is for a more dramatic look. You wouldn&#8217;t use it for a simple black liner look. It&#8217;s impossible to make it thin-lined. Since I messed up a bit, I went back over it with my holy grail tattoo liner from Kat Von D.</p>
<p>The mascara was much better than I expected! The massive brush reminds me of a DNA strand. It also comes separate from the base of the mascara. When you put the applicator in, you can really tell how black the formula is because the brush is orange-red. This mascara is really reasonable at $8.99. I think I could use this instead of my Marc Jacobs mascara!</p>
<p>I used the primer under my Kat Von D liquid foundation. I didn&#8217;t notice a big difference because I already mix my foundation with a primer. It says it&#8217;s for combo skin. This product I wouldn&#8217;t purchase since I&#8217;m sold on Kat&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Covergirl Colorlicious Oh Sugar! Lip Balm in Candy was really cool. I loved the smell and the packaging was pretty and sleek. The only drawback is it didn&#8217;t have any pigment. It said it was supposed to have some color, but it&#8217;s more of a clear balm. It seemed to me as if it was Covergirl&#8217;s version of Fresh&#8217;s Sugar products. Overall, it was a good clear balm that I&#8217;ll use over lipstick or on days I&#8217;m not wearing lip color.</p>
<p>Did you receive this box free? What do you think of Covergirl?</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>There’s just something about getting a little gift in the mail every month. When I was a little girl, I would run out to the mail to check if I had received letters or packages. One of my fondest mail memories was opening a package sent from Santa Claus that had a bunch of stationary and coloring pages. Years later, I’m still fascinated by snail mail and the new movement of “happy mail.” A way I indulge this little desire to receive a doorstep package every month is by subscribing to different subscription services.</p>
<p>Ipsy is an online beauty community created by Youtube star and makeup artist <a href="http://michellephan.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Michelle Phan</a>. In addition to offering videos and creative beauty content, the site’s main attraction is the <a href="http://www.ipsy.com/r/1dr1?sid=ipsypoints&amp;cid=general&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">monthly Glam Bag</a>. For $10, you can receive a curated makeup bag filled with goodies that are put together especially for you! Now, I know $10 can be a stretch for something a little extra, but I’ve noticed I purchase much less makeup and beauty products since receiving this monthly goodie (ask my husband)! Also, the products are great quality and add up to much more than $10.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong>Here’s what I received for the month of February!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0100.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-40" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0100-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0100" width="449" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0100-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 678w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0100-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0100-768x1160.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0100-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0100-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0100.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1632w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://eva-nyc.com/products/up-all-night-volumizing-spray-8-oz?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Up All Night Volumizing Spray by Eva NYC</a>, about $6 for sample size </strong></p>
<p>I tried the Up All Night Volumizing Spray on damp hair and allowed it to air-dry. The product is designed for blow-outs but I noticed it gave me more volume even though I didn&#8217;t hit my hair with my blow dryer! The smell is deliciously fresh. I really appreciate the fact you can use it to protect your hair from heating tools.</p>

<p>This face brush by Luxie Beauty has the same quality as (gasp) my Sephora brushes! The bristles are extra soft and create the perfect blush application. I really like the wide handle and have used it for both bronzer and the blush which was included in the bag. I’m glad the product is cruelty-free and would purchase more brushes from Luxie Beauty. I think this is the very first blush/face brush I’ve received in the two years I’ve been a subscriber. I really like that they included a blush and brush to go together for this look.</p>

<p>As much as I love the color pink, I don&#8217;t do light pink lipglosses. I tried this sample and liked the color payoff but not the color. It went on smooth and stayed on, but wasn&#8217;t for me. I&#8217;d love to try another shade!</p>

<p>When I saw this blush, I thought it looked too pigmented to create a more natural look. I was wrong! I used the included Luxie brush and lightly tapped it on my cheeks. After blending it out, I had created a natural looking pink flush! I have <a href="http://www.sephora.com/blush-P2855?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">NARS Organism </a>and love it but it has a lot of shimmer. This is a more peachy color and doesn’t have much shimmer. For my sister’s wedding makeup, I added some and then used<a href="http://www.sephora.com/bronzing-powder-P12790?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank"> NARS Laguna bronzer </a>underneath. It looked beautiful! Note to self: don’t write a product off just because the packaging or by first impression!</p>

<p>I’m glancing down at my hand and can still see a trace from the eyeliner that I used when doing my sister’s makeup yesterday. The liner that was included in February’s Ipsy bag has been my jam! I’m not a huge fan of purple liners and usually wear my go-to <a href="http://www.sephora.com/tattoo-liner-P245205?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Kat Von D Tattoo black liner</a> but this stuff is great. The product glides on smooth and stays put. The color is a deep purple that looks really great with cool shadow colors. I had never heard of Pencil Me In Cosmetics and wasn’t sure about them until I tried the liner. On further inspection, I learned the brand has been featured in some notable magazines like <em>Women’s Day</em> and <em>Seventeen</em> and it’s made without harmful petroleum and parabens (win-win)! Pencil Me In Cosmetics offers thirty different colors in their liners and they’re about $7 each. This is one of main reasons why I adore Ipsy &#8211; I love trying new products and learning about new brands! I would’ve never even thought to try this kind of liner and am surprised at the quality and color payoff.</p>
<h2>Overall: I loved this months bag!</h2>
<p>The total products were totaled at about $57 and it included a cute pink cosmetics bag. For $10, I was really impressed and will use the majority of the items. My favorite was the liner and Luxie brush!
