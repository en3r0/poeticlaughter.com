<p>Are you a big fan of red velvet cupcakes? I am!  This summer I decided to do some baking for my birthday. We went camping with the family and I wanted to create something extra special. Believe-it-or-not, I&#8217;d never made red velvet cupcakes from scratch before.</p>
<p>They turned out fabulous! The cake was moist and the cream cheese frosting had the perfect tangy-ness to it. My only regret was that it was very hot in my kitchen and the pretty frosting melted. As soon as I noticed it falling, (after meticulously frosting them with a decorating gun) I placed them in the refrigerator to cool and set up.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cupcakeonplateupclose.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-706" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cupcakeonplateupclose-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="cupcakeonplateupclose" width="678" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cupcakeonplateupclose-678x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 678w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cupcakeonplateupclose-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cupcakeonplateupclose-768x1160.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cupcakeonplateupclose-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cupcakeonplateupclose-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cupcakeonplateupclose.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></a></p>
<p>They were a big hit! A few people were fighting over them and Dustin, my husband wanted lots more. I found the cute matching red sprinkles at a local shop called <a href="http://www.pumpkinseedbulkfood.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Pumpkin Seed Bulk Food</a>. The Pumpkin Seed has lots of different spices and baking supplies at really good prices.</p>
<p>I found the recipe from Allrecipes.com. I looked at a few different ones, but this one seemed the easiest and had the best reviews. Once I was done, I felt very proud of myself because they looked as great as they tasted. (Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t turn out that way.) Here are the ingredients:</p>
<h4>Red Velvet Cupcakes</h4>
<p>-2 1/2 cups flour</p>
<p>-1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</p>
<p>-1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p>-1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
<p>-1 cup butter, softened</p>
<p>-2 cups sugar</p>
<p>-4 eggs</p>
<p>-1 cup sour cream</p>
<p>-1/2 cup milk</p>
<p>-1 (1 ounce) red food color</p>
<p>-2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p>
<h4>Vanilla Cream Cheese Frosting</h4>
<p>-1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese</p>
<p>-1/4 cup butter, softened</p>
<p>-2 tablespoons sour cream</p>
<p>-2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p>
<p>-1 (16 ounce) box of confectioners sugar</p>

<h4>Some Tips From A Gal Who Made Them</h4>
<p>-Make sure you ice them in a cool place or else the icing will melt and look ugly!</p>
<p>-Use lots of red food coloring for the red color to show up.</p>
<p>-Don&#8217;t over-mix the cake or else it won&#8217;t rise.</p>
<p>-Buy some pretty nonpareils (round sprinkles).</p>
<p>Let me know if you try them! Have you made red velvet cupcakes before?</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>
<p>P.S. The fun white tree trunk display was purchased from T.J. MAXX. We used it and others for my little sister&#8217;s Alice In Wonderland bridal shower!</p>

<p>Have you heard of Pinchme? I discovered them a few years back when I was obsessed with getting free things sent to me in the mail. Although I still love free samples, I find that I only sign up for things I know I&#8217;ll use. I have a kazillion foil packets at home that are collecting dust.</p>
<p>Pinchme is a website where you can sign up for free samples. There aren&#8217;t any catches. They send you a box of samples if you qualify. You don&#8217;t have to jump through hoops or pay a cent. No credit cards. No spam. They send you email updates and let you know when you can sign up for a box. You pick up to three or four samples and you receive it for free. All you have to do is re-log in and review the items you received. In the past I&#8217;ve gotten perfume samples and other wonderful items. This month, I opened my box and found:</p>
<p><strong>Neutrogena Hand Cream </strong></p>
<p>An itty bitty little hand cream that&#8217;s .5 ounces. It smells like lotion and looks like beauty primer. It is kinda clear-ish and disappears once it&#8217;s rubbed in. According to Neutrogena, this product is their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CPZFWQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005CPZFWQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=GWKCQSZUMJIEHCQF&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Norwegian Formula</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B005CPZFWQ&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> which is supposed to moisturize your hands without leaving a greasy feel. As soon as I used it, I began typing and my fingers stuck to the keys. Although it does seem greasy, it definitely moisturizes. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be buying this &#8211; or even finishing the sample. Bummer.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxapril.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-460" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxapril-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="pinchmeboxapril" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxapril.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxapril-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxapril-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxapril-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Sunny Body Natural Sunscreen </strong></p>
<p>This 1 ounce sample is really cute. We&#8217;re running off to Myrtle Beach this month so it&#8217;s the perfect thing to try. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BPZ1L0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002BPZ1L0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=7T35DUWBBMULK2IX&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Sunny Body Natural Sunscreen</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002BPZ1L0&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> is a sunscreen that&#8217;s made of some organic ingredients! From Goddess Garden Organics, this product offers a broad spectrum SPF of 30 and it&#8217;s water resistant for 40 minutes. I was a little thrown off by the branding. I thought it was 100% organic, but it only has SOME ingredients like sunflower oil and aloe vera that are.  It smells like sunscreen. Nothing special there. I haven&#8217;t tried it yet but will while on vacation at the beach. On the side of the tube it says &#8220;sheer mineral lotion, biodegradable, cruelty free, reef safe, non-GMO&#8221; I&#8217;ve never heard of the brand, Goddess Garden, so we&#8217;ll have to wait and see. You can purchase it on Amazon for $13.49 for 3.5 ounces.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxopenapril.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-462" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxopenapril-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="pinchmeboxopenapril" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxopenapril.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxopenapril-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxopenapril-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxopenapril-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Gevalia Kaffe </strong></p>
<p>Ok, I&#8217;m addicted. I love coffee samples. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;ve tried them&#8230;you still get them. This little .84 ounce bag is good for four cups of coffee. I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MBEK5UI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00MBEK5UI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=ENQ6YAMSPA7SRT4V&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Gevalia</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00MBEK5UI&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> ok. I&#8217;m not a huge fan. I&#8217;d prefer Starbucks but, hey, it&#8217;s free. I got a sample of the house blend which is a medium roast. It comes already ground.</p>
<p><strong>Nivea In-Shower Body Lotion </strong></p>
<p>I hate foil packets but I can&#8217;t complain because it&#8217;s absolutely free. This little sample is of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NV9KLXS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00NV9KLXS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=3HIVJBEPHXVTSJLQ&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Nivea Body In-Shower Nourishing Body Lotion</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00NV9KLXS&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. I get it. Some people have extra dry skin and need this. I&#8217;m not one of them. I usually take a bath to feel less icky and not put on lotion. BUT part of blogging is trying new things and letting you guys know what I think. I&#8217;ll give it a shot.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxlayedout.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-461" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxlayedout-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="pinchmeboxlayedout" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxlayedout.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxlayedout-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxlayedout-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pinchmeboxlayedout-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>Overall: It&#8217;s Free &amp; Fabulous</h2>
<p>Pinchme sends free samples at no cost to you. They just ask you take a little survey once you try them. I love it. It&#8217;s an easy way to try new products and get free coffee samples. It&#8217;s also nice to get a box in the mail. FOR FREE. You can sign up <a href="https://www.pinchme.com?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>*I don&#8217;t receive anything for you joining. I&#8217;ve been a member for about one year.</p>

If you&#8217;re checking this post out, chances are you&#8217;ve already seen some of my blog and want to know a little bit more about me and what I&#8217;m about. (Or where I began)</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;ve become a world-wide-web phenomenon and I&#8217;m working with Sephora and Taylor Swift is my bestie and calls me when her cats aren&#8217;t getting along.</p>
<p>Or&#8230; you may have just stumbled upon this itty bitty section of the internet by accident or by looking up information about T-swift&#8217;s <a href="http://www.etonline.com/news/2014/12/24121965/set_taylor_swift_coca_cola_640.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">cats</a>.</p>
<p>However you got here: I hope we can become fast friends and you&#8217;ll want to click around and stay awhile.</p>
<p><strong>Poeticlaughter is a blog dedicated to life and beauty through the lens of love.</strong></p>
<p>The journey to begin this blog is a long one with many attempts and failures. I remember when I lived in Chicago (in 2010) and worked in an office. I hated it. I lacked creativity and was sick of getting everyone&#8217;s mail everyday. Deep inside I knew I had <strong>more to offer the world</strong> and that I just needed the <strong>right push. </strong></p>
<p>A few years went by and we moved to Ohio. I began freelance writing and learned to have the confidence I needed to run an online business and express myself as a writer. Many different beauty blogs approached me and I wrote a lot about interior design, beauty, and travel. As I wrote, I realized I wanted to create <strong>something organic</strong>&#8230;something new that I wasn&#8217;t being monitored to write. It was through reading lots of different books about online business and flipping through many magazines that I realized:</p>
<p><strong>I have something unique to offer.</strong> There aren&#8217;t many beauty and lifestyle blogs that follow the latest trends but with an uplifting, empowering believers perspective.</p>
<p>So what does Poeticlaughter mean? It means that there is beauty and poetry in our life and laughter. It means that you can laugh at yourself and embrace your unique God-given talents in a way that doesn&#8217;t make others feel less-than. It means that whether you&#8217;re in your teens or are navigating retirement you can be beautiful inside and out while<strong> leaving your own mark on the world. </strong></p>
<p>On poeticlaughter.com I&#8217;ll be your guide, blogging about the latest in makeup, home decor, relationships and life! Although my primary focus will be on <strong>beauty</strong>, you may see glimpses of my personal life. I&#8217;m learning to love myself  well and the world around me one day at a time. Join me and learn a thing or two about lipstick, the latest in skincare, and if that hyped-up mascara is really worth $24.</p>
<p>Oh, and there may be a few posts about cats.</p>
