<h2><a href="http://www.oribe.com/dry-texturizing-spray.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray </a></h2>
<p>This fancy stuff retails at $44. Yikes! That&#8217;s a lot for a dry texturizing spray. I had heard of the brand before and wanted to try it. I received a perfume from Birchbox before in the scent. It&#8217;s supposed to be a cult-favorite. Thus far I haven&#8217;t had a chance to use it. I just don&#8217;t use dry products very often. But I will&#8230;eventually. Bonus: it smells good!</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.birchbox.com/shop/the-beauty-crop-pbj-smoothie-stick-guava-nice-day?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">PBJ Smoothie Stick Creamy Lip Crayon</a></h2>
<p>When I saw this, I was so excited. It&#8217;s bright and I love the packaging. Well, it came kind of melted since the weather was hot. I get that. No problem. But, the consistency and color was awful. The product didn&#8217;t go on smooth and made me look like an oompa loompa. It contains sweet almond oil, which is cool, but the color was way off. In fact, I will probably toss it. (It&#8217;s that bad). I wouldn&#8217;t buy it for $5, much less $14.95</p>

<p>Woohoo! A skin care product I&#8217;ve debated buying myself! This product by Paula&#8217;s Choice is an exfoliant that retails at $28. I&#8217;ve had this in my cart before online. It&#8217;s pricey, so I&#8217;ll try it before I consider buying it. My skin isn&#8217;t too great so hopefully this will help with redness. It says, &#8220;This leave-on exfoliant wipes away impurities to reveal smooth, even-toned, glowing skin.&#8221; Sign me up!</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.sephora.com/gimme-brow-P409239?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Gimme Brow Volumizing Fiber Gel by Benefit</a></h2>
<p>The very last item included in June&#8217;s Birchbox was the Gimme Brow sample from Benefit. I&#8217;ve tried a version of this product before and was actually sent a full size free on behalf of Ipsy three years ago. I like it a lot. The wand helps you color in your brow and it stays put for quite some time. The only issue is that I found a NYX version a lot cheaper. For $6.99 NYX&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ulta.com/tinted-brow-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod11861069&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Tinted Brow Mascara</a> seemed to work just as well. The full sized <a href="http://www.ulta.com/gimme-brow-volumizing-fiber-gel?productId=xlsImpprod14191015&amp;_requestid=2528184&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Gimme Brow is $24</a>. I don&#8217;t see that big of a difference in the quality other than it may stay longer. Either way, these products are super nice and give your face a &#8220;finished&#8221; look.</p>
<p>Overall the box was just OK. I hope July&#8217;s is better.</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>
<p>Ps- I don&#8217;t receive anything from writing this and I paid for the box myself. If you click on <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/5d724?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">this link and sign up</a> I will get referral points though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If you put FREE100 and sign up for a <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/5d724?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">subscription</a> you&#8217;ll get $10 to spend in the Birchbox store!</p>

<p>Happy Easter Friends!</p>
<p>This was a memorable Easter for me. Dustin and I attended the Maundy Thursday service at our church. It&#8217;s been an interesting development for me as a Christ-follower because I never celebrated this day. In fact, NONE of the churches I attended had a service dedicated to this day. So, the last few years we&#8217;ve been learning about Maundy Thursday and what it means. Basically, Maundy Thursday is the day when Jesus and his disciples went to the upper room and had communion and he washed their feet. (And yes, even some Christians think it&#8217;s strange that we do this)</p>
<p>Maundy is Latin. It comes from mandatum, which means &#8220;command.&#8221;</p>
<h1>Washing My Husband&#8217;s Feet. It&#8217;s Awkward As It Sounds.</h1>
<p>We were asked to serve and as most things go at Mosaic, our church,  (on the fly) we found out once we arrived we may be needed to wash feet. Now, the whole thing is awkward. Anyone who tells you different has either 1.) been doing it a long time or 2.) isn&#8217;t aware of social norms in the 21rst century!</p>
<p>You&#8217;re on your knees. You&#8217;re touching someone&#8217;s (you may not know) feet. <strong>You&#8217;re not sure if you should scrub it, rub it, or go in-between the toes. It&#8217;s vulnerable and sacred and scary all at the same time. </strong></p>
<p>So, we embraced the command and followed in Jesus&#8217; footsteps and washed others feet. Men on one side, women on the other. We pour water over the feet, rub it a bit, and then dry it with a fresh towel. It&#8217;s all very hygienic and you don&#8217;t have to worry about the man in the back with athlete&#8217;s foot since we don&#8217;t share water. It takes a minute or two. Getting your feet washed is just as humbling as washing. It&#8217;s a very special moment.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t get a chance to wash anyones feet at first because all the women were doing one another&#8217;s. Dustin, on the other hand, was on his knees at the first pew washing from the beginning. It was a very special thing to watch him serve his brothers in Christ and reflect Jesus. At the end, I felt as if I should wash his feet, a prodding from the Holy Spirit. It&#8217;s a strange feeling and I&#8217;ll be honest:<strong> I didn&#8217;t want to do it.</strong> I touch his feet all the time (rubbing them, laying on the couch, etc) but it was awkward. I still knew it was important and would be a very special way to pray over him and  humble myself.</p>
<p>So, we washed each other&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>It was a super sweet moment. One I will never forget. To follow in the footsteps of our Father and submit to one another in love. Phenomenal. I prayed prayers as I touched his feet. God, give him strength. Give him Hope. Give him more and more love for you. Before long, we switched and he washed my feet. It was a very intimate moment.</p>
<p>I had a good understanding of washing feet before engaging in this symbolic ritual, but others may not.</p>

<h1>Why Do We Wash Each Other&#8217;s Feet As Believers?</h1>
<p>Today, as I was reading my devotional, I was shocked to come across the passage where Jesus washes the disciples feet. Now, I do a devotional at random. It&#8217;s not a date specified book and is a book about prayer. It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lifeway.com/Product/whispers-of-hope-p005567167?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Whispers of Hope by Beth Moore.</a> When I came across this section, I was encouraged. God knows I needed a reminder again about why we wash feet.</p>
<p>The passage can be found in John 13. If you take the time to read it, (and I encourage you to do so) it paints the story of Jesus washing his best friends and confidant&#8217;s feet. It says &#8220;he loved them to the end(John 13:1)&#8221; and &#8220;knew that the Father has put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God. (13:1)&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a simple process. He &#8220;poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ok, so, Jesus did this. Why do we? He was doing this with his disciples, why do I need to do it for others and my family? The answer is in verse 14.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another&#8217;s feet. I have set an example that you should do as I have done for you. Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Washing feet is a symbol. It&#8217;s not just about washing feet. It&#8217;s about humbling yourself both ways and allowing someone to serve you or serving another in a very real, raw, awkward way. It&#8217;s about putting someone before yourself.</p>
<p>We can wash other&#8217;s feet everyday without picking up a basin of water. Simply by putting others needs in front of your own is obeying this command.</p>
<p>Today, while I make the bed, mix up some lunch, or kiss my husband I&#8217;m reminded that I can wash his feet and humble myself like Jesus without physically washing his feet every day. Who in your life can you serve and put before yourself?</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still catching up! I received <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=1dr1&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">June&#8217;s Ipsy bag </a>and have had the pictures waiting to be published.</p>
<h3>The bag wasn&#8217;t horrible, but it wasn&#8217;t the best bag I&#8217;ve had from them.</h3>
<p>There were about three things I really loved. To begin, the bag was an interesting material. It has &#8220;ipsy&#8221; all over it with a top orangish colored zipper closure. I personally thought it was ugly so I&#8217;ll be passing it on to someone else. The most recognizable branded item was the <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EG07BM0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00EG07BM0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=UI42YDEPDRUZGQIX&quot;&gt;Smashbox&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Photo Finish OIL-FREE Foundation Primer .25 fl. oz (DLX Travel Size) NEW!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00EG07BM0&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;">Smashbox Cosmetics Photo Finish Foundation Primer</a>. As you can see, it isn&#8217;t pictured because I used it up! The other brand I recognized was <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FSD402I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00FSD402I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=3OMMU4ZF473BVDOF&quot;&gt;Lavanila&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss The Healthy Body Butter: Pure Vanilla - 6.7 oz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00FSD402I&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;">Lavanilla</a>. I was happy to get this sample because I&#8217;ve wanted to try their lotions.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of what I received and their values!</p>
<h3>Smashbox Cosmetics Photo Finish Foundation Primer, $8</h3>
<p>This was an exciting sample for me. I love <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DJ57GHS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00DJ57GHS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=I2KS74VFZEOLZZGB&quot;&gt;Smashbox&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Try It Kit: Halo + BB Light/Medium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00DJ57GHS&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank">Smashbox Cosmetics</a> and this primer helps your makeup stay on forever. It feels really slippery and fills in all your pores. It basically perfects your skin before putting on other layers. It&#8217;s also good for oil-prone skin like mine!</p>
<h3>Pure Vanilla The Healthy Body Butter Instant Hydration by Lavanila Laboratories, $4</h3>
<p>This sample was wonderful. The warm scent of the vanilla was really strong and it stayed on my skin. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t find it as moisturizing as I&#8217;d hoped. It didn&#8217;t seem to make my hands softer in the long run. What I do love about this brand is that it&#8217;s 100% all natural. I wouldn&#8217;t buy a full sized item, but I&#8217;d welcome more samples of other scents.</p>
<h3>tre&#8217;StiQue Mini Shadow Crayon in Kona Coffee, $10</h3>
<p>This is a brand that Ipsy has been including lately. I think this is the first item I received from them. It was OK. Nothing too spectacular. I liked the shape of the crayon and the pigmentation was alright. It&#8217;s one of those products that isn&#8217;t worth the crazy high price tag for the quality. A full size is $26. I&#8217;d rather buy shadow crayons from more established brands for that price. <strong>I haven&#8217;t used it once since June. </strong></p>

<h3>Liptitude Hydrating Lip Stain by J.Cat Beauty, $5.99</h3>
<p>When I first saw this lip color, I thought it was a throw-in and nothing special. The color looked OK, but the name, Liptitude, seemed juvenile. When I opened it, I decided to try it. The color was fantastic! My husband even said it looked great on. I think the shade I received was called <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0100SY1OW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0100SY1OW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=YWC4QK43BT63IPGZ&quot;&gt;J&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Cat Liptitude Lip Stain 115 Blow Your Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0100SY1OW&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank">Blow Your Mind</a>. My mum saw it on me and also wanted one. Eventually I noticed it did move around on my lips. The color stayed, since it&#8217;s a stain, but I had trouble keeping it in place. The formula was thick and a little messy. Since I liked the shade so much, I think I&#8217;ll try it with a clear lip liner. Overall, I liked the sample, but won&#8217;t buy it since it was a little messy and had a strange smell.</p>

<h3>BioRepublic Soothing Fiber Masks (3), $14.95</h3>
<p>Three masks! Woohoo! That&#8217;s a great &#8220;one item.&#8221; A set of three masks is valued at $14.95. In the picture there is one missing because I tried it the night I opened the bag. Overall these masks worked well. They seemed to help with my irritated skin and smelled really great. I don&#8217;t think they work as well as <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MXQEFQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004MXQEFQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=BKLMQXKPA44RWGXJ&quot;&gt;Karuna&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Clarifying + Face Mask, 0.95 fl. oz.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004MXQEFQ&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank">Karuna</a> masks or <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009GYVMAS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B009GYVMAS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=X5QV2YK55CD2BC5N&quot;&gt;GLAMGLOW&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Super-MudTM Clearing Treatment 1.2 oz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B009GYVMAS&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank">GlamGlow</a>, but they were the perfect addition for the June bag.<a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZIS507C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00ZIS507C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=ODC6QLI6ZJMB5UWH&quot;&gt;BioRepublic&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss Skincare Cucumber Breeze 3 Mask Set&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00ZIS507C&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank"> BioRepublic</a> is a really interesting brand. It was developed by Americans who traveled in Asia. The website says,</p>
<p>&#8220;Not being ones to accept the status quo, Justin and Paolo immediately set out to create their own line of sheet masks, inspired by Korean products but formulated with American tastes and values. Now they’re bringing their masks to you, without parabens, sulfates, pthalates, or triclosan. 100% cruelty-free.  Dermatologist tested and totally <a title="BioRepublic SkinCare - Ingredient Safety" href="http://www.biorepublic.com/pages/ingredient-safety?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">transparent</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t tried a sheet mask yet, you should! They work really well and are inexpensive.</p>

<p>Overall I liked my bag. I don&#8217;t have a lot of complaints because I feel as if I got my $10 worth of products. I loved the masks and the primer. Did you get this bag? What have you been using since June? If you give it some time, then you learn what you really use on a regular basis and prefer!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>

<p>I about peed my pants when I found out I was selected to try the latest makeup line from <a href="http://www.ysl.com/us?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Yves Saint Laurent</a>! For those that don&#8217;t know, the brand is pretty pricey and is offered from the world-famous luxury brand. Personally, I&#8217;ve tried a handful of samples from YSL, but I&#8217;ve never tried any full sized items.</p>
<p>So, how did I receive this crazy nice makeup swag? Well, I&#8217;ve been a member of <a href="https://www.influenster.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Influenster </a>for about three years now. This program is online and allows different people to try new products and give feedback. Now, it helps that I have a lot of Facebook friends and have my own beauty blog. I think that&#8217;s why they send me more makeup than others. The program is completely free and I&#8217;m not paid to say anything in particular about the brands. In the past I&#8217;ve tried razors, makeup items, and even vitamins! This package is by far the highest valued item I&#8217;ve been sent and it made my day! I plan on writing a post later about how to become an Influenster and what to do to get sent some of the higher value items to sample. In the meantime, if you&#8217;re curious, just click <a href="https://www.influenster.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">here</a> and begin working on your profile and connecting your social media to the site.</p>

<p>Before I received this box, I received an email with a set of questions to answer. I answered that I loved makeup and was a Very Important Beauty Insider at <a href="http://www.sephora.com/?&amp;om_mmc=ppc-GG&amp;mkwid=sGT137elx&amp;pcrid=68913499937&amp;pdv=c&amp;site=us_search&amp;country_switch=us&amp;lang=en&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwr8uuBRCcg6-s-4TrmIsBEiQAN1TdEYff65jvto8nmfAqw811Cx0ItjCqJedqih4CRHRBdscaAg8v8P8HAQ&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Sephora</a> (I send $350+ per year there). Once I finished the set of questions, I received a confirmation email that I was receiving the box. It came a few days later and looked like this.</p>

<p>Inside the box were two different YSL products and an insert with information about the Touch Eclat Blur line. The two main products were <a href="http://www.sephora.com/touche-eclat-blur-primer-P397615?skuId=1713114&amp;icid2=brand:yves%20saint%20laurent__p397615_image&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Touche Eclat Blur Primer</a> and the <a href="http://www.sephora.com/touche-eclat-blur-perfector-P397617?skuId=1713122&amp;icid2=brand:yves%20saint%20laurent__p397617_image&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Touch Eclat Blur Perfector</a>.</p>

<h2>Yves Saint Laurent Touch Eclat Blue Perfector</h2>
<p>When I opened the packaging I swear I had hearts in my eyes. The compact is  beautiful and very luxurious to hold. The packaging is a pale pink with the iconic YSL logo in gold. Once you open the rectangular compact, there is a mirror and then the product. So, what in the world is this pink formula supposed to do?</p>
<p>According to Sephora, the product is a blur perfector. This means that the formula will help matte-ify your skin, blur overlarge pores, and give you a warm glow. The exact description says</p>
<p>&#8220;This portable perfector is Yves Saint Laurent’s first ever blur perfector encased within a compact. It transforms from a balm to a powder upon application to soften the skin’s imperfections—creating a transparent yet subtle, rosy-glow effect. Use it alone as an allover complexion perfector, to set makeup, or as a mattifying touch up to sweep away shine and hide imperfections. Featuring one universal shade that complements all skin types, it instantly minimizes the look of pores so that skin feels smoother and the complexion appears more even. &#8221;</p>
<p>So, what did I think? Even though the packaging was beautiful&#8230;<strong>I didn&#8217;t like it</strong>. As soon as I opened it, I applied it on top of my <a href="http://www.sephora.com/lock-it-tattoo-foundation-P311138?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Kat Von D Lock It Tattoo</a> foundation. The formula from YSL didn&#8217;t mix well and basically made my makeup come off. I noticed the liquid makeup separated and drew even more attention to my large pores (sigh).</p>
<p>I thought maybe it was how it mixed with my foundation. I tried another day by wearing it alone. I didn&#8217;t notice a big difference, but my husband said my pores around my nose did seem smaller.</p>
<p>You use a sponge to apply the cream which then turns into a powder. The formula feels great going on and seems to eliminate oil. Unfortunately, I wear liquid makeup almost everyday. This type of product doesn&#8217;t work well with my go-to foundation so I won&#8217;t have a need for it. Along with trying it all over on top of my foundation, I also used it under and it did the same thing. Another time I only used it near my oily t-zone and again, it didn&#8217;t deliver. It was super disappointing for such an expensive and beautiful product. On Sephora, a lot of beauty lovers are saying they&#8217;re addicted to it. Perhaps it works better with other foundations? I may try to mix it with my <a href="http://www.clinique.com/product/1599/6201/Makeup/Foundations/Almost-Powder-Makeup-Broad-Spectrum-SPF-15?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Clinique Almost Powder Makeup</a> on a day when I&#8217;m not doing a full face of makeup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sephora.com/touche-eclat-blur-perfector-P397617?skuId=1713122&amp;icid2=brand:yves%20saint%20laurent__p397617_image&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">YSL Touch Eclat Blue Perfector</a> cam be purchased at Sephora for $55. If you didn&#8217;t get the hint already, I won&#8217;t be purchasing it. I feel as if there isn&#8217;t a need for this in my day-to-day makeup routine.</p>

<h2>Yves Saint Laurent Touch Eclat Blur Primer</h2>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve found my new favorite primer! After the disappointment of the compact, I was beginning to think Yves Saint Laurent products weren&#8217;t as great as I thought they were supposed to be. Thankfully, the primer proved me wrong. I received the primer from Influenster and it was a small sample size. The container has a gold top and has small flecks of gold suspended in the liquid. You apply it with a small sponge applicator. Overall, the product is supposed to help your makeup go on smooth, blur complexion imperfections, and give you a healthy glow. Sephora says,</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.sephora.com/touche-eclat-blur-primer-P397615?skuId=1713114&amp;icid2=brand:yves%20saint%20laurent__p397615_image&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Touche Elcat Blur Primer</a> preps skin for foundation application, creating an improved, refined appearance: pores seem to be minimized, skin texture feels smoother, and skintone is more even. It’s enriched with four nourishing oils—corn oil, apricot kernel oil, passiflora oil, and rice bran oil—to leave skin feeling incredibly soft without a greasy residue. Packed with blur technology, this universal primer provides a subtle, golden shimmer for ultimate luminosity. &#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Boy, did this help my makeup stay put!</strong> It worked beautifully under my Kat Von D foundation (unlike the compact version) and made my skin look flawless. I even received a few compliments on my skin when wearing it. The gold flecks are interesting. I didn&#8217;t see them on my skin. I suppose they blend in? The formula is very silky. I felt like I needed a lot to cover my entire face. It absorbs quickly and helps acne stars look less noticeable. I&#8217;ve purchased <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/lancome-la-base-pro-perfecting-makeup-primer/2992830?cm_mmc=Google_Product_Ads_pla_online-_-datafeed-_-women:makeup:foundation-_-235900&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwr8uuBRCcg6-s-4TrmIsBEiQAN1TdEaEaNimtycUaQr3llCbTPb4IVdsELq2roZkrqe9_hsoaAmyi8P8HAQ&amp;mr:referralID=2ec03cf7-460c-11e5-8a28-0050569451e5&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Lancomes&#8217; LA BASE PRO</a> for $42 in the past. I would say the Yves Saint Laurent Touche Eclat Blur Primer works a tad bit better. It seemed to keep my makeup on just as long and go on just as smooth. The difference is that the YSL product helped my skin have a healthy glow. The Lancome primer didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Touche Eclat Blur Primer is $52 for one ounce of product. It&#8217;s a little bit larger than Lancome&#8217;s (.2 ounces more). I think trying this through Influenster has definitely won me over. I saw a promotion at Sephora to receive a deluxe sample of the primer. I spent some money just to get another container of it! Now, can I get myself to invest in a $36 <a href="http://www.sephora.com/rouge-pur-couture-satin-radiance-lipstick-P272319?skuId=1293463&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">YSL lipstick</a>? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I received both products FREE through <a href="https://www.influenster.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Influenster</a> for testing purposes. My opinions are, of course, my own. If I like something, I&#8217;ll let you know. If I think it&#8217;s a waste of a dollar&#8230;I&#8217;ll let you know that, too.</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>After being an <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=1dr1&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Ipsy</a> member for over three years, I decided to give <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/5d724?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Birchbox</a> a try. I had received their emails for a long time and was extremely jealous of all the great products other gals were posting. Without hesitation, I signed up for the Mad Men Box this past April (a little behind, I know).<a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/5d724?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank"> Birchbox</a> is the first beauty subscription service and their boxes are only $10 a month including shipping and handling. I&#8217;ve noticed a lot of their products are similar to Ipsy&#8217;s but there are more skin care items. My first box was remarkable. Here&#8217;s what I received!</p>

<p>The box was inspired by Mad Men, the addictive TV show on AMC. The pink retro style of the box was adorable and there was a promo insert. Each item included was something that the women of Mad Men may have used.</p>

<h4>Anastasia Beverly Hills Clear Brow Gel</h4>
<p>This product was one of the items that I was most excited to try. I&#8217;ve heard a lot about Anastasia Beverly Hills, but haven&#8217;t tried any of the their products. This <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GI21NZA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00GI21NZA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=SKMGF7PGF56M4PVH&quot;&gt;clear&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss gel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00GI21NZA&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank">clear gel</a> works like a hair spray and holds your brows in place. The brush looks like a mascara wand and you brush it through your brows. I really liked the formula but the smell was a little strong. For the price, I think I might be able to find a cheaper alternative. Full size is $22. The sample was probably worth about $8. I liked that it works on any colored brow and that it doesn&#8217;t budge once it&#8217;s put in place. Although it&#8217;s not a staple, I&#8217;ve been using it about once every week or so.</p>

<h4>Beauty Protector Protect &amp; Oil</h4>
<p>If you want your hair to  stay in place and smell like vanilla cupcakes, buy this product by the gallons! <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/shop/beauty-protector-protect-and-oil?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Beauty Protector Protect &amp; Oil</a> was a product I needed in my life that I didn&#8217;t even know about. This tiny vial has lasted me a long time and helps smooth out my frizzy hair. It isn&#8217;t greasy feeling and has a delicious smell. Of all the items I&#8217;ve sampled from Birchbox (since April) this is one of my very favorite and I plan on buying the full sized option. Beauty Protector also sells other hair products I&#8217;d like to try in the future. A full size is about $26, so I&#8217;d guess this little sample is worth about $4.</p>

<h4>Cargo Swimmables Water Resistant Blush</h4>
<p>Why anyone needs a blush that is water-resistant is beyond me. I  don&#8217;t wear makeup when I&#8217;m planning on swimming and when I do, it&#8217;s not blush! That being said, this product is really nice. I like the color, which is called Los Cabos. It&#8217;s a soft tangerine. You can apply if using your fingers or using a blush brush. I like the little tin it comes in. The size is perfect because I usually don&#8217;t use too much blush to begin with. There&#8217;s a subtle shimmer that&#8217;s also great for the summer. Full sized is $26. This sample is worth about $12. You can find other shades on Amazon<a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FKJ6QEK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00FKJ6QEK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=K7LY7GVD7KNTN5BD&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00FKJ6QEK&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank"> here</a>.</p>

<h4>Liz Earle Eyebright Soothing Eye Lotion</h4>
<p>I don&#8217;t have issues with under eye circles. I thought I wouldn&#8217;t ever use <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/shop/liz-earle-eyebright-soothing-eye-lotion?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">this product</a>&#8230;until I began using it to take my eye makeup off! The formula doesn&#8217;t irritate my eyes and helps me get all the black eyeliner off my lids. The smell is fresh and leaves my skin with a tight feeling. I read the directions and used it a few times as a treatment. You soak some cotton balls and lay with them over your eyes for a few minutes. My eyes looked so fresh and bright once I took the time to let the product do its magic. I don&#8217;t think this is a &#8220;must-have&#8221; item, but it helps a lot and I&#8217;m excited to have it in my <del>hoard</del> collection. Full price $25. Sample about $8-10.</p>
<h4>Whish Shaving Cream</h4>
<p>This product was kinda silly. It&#8217;s a $20 <a href="http://&lt;a?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FENBZ0M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00FENBZ0M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=poeticlaughte-20&amp;linkId=S24ZHQUZEYPL4MUZ&quot;&gt;shaving&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss cream&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=poeticlaughte-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00FENBZ0M&quot;&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank">shaving cream</a>. The sample was ok and I used it up but I wouldn&#8217;t spend $20 on shaving cream. The smell was yummy. Blueberry I think. BUT&#8230;$20?! C&#8217;mon. It&#8217;s supposed to help sensitive skin and keep your skin hydrated. I didn&#8217;t notice a difference between this and off brand Skintimate at Walmart. The sample size is valued at about $5 maybe?</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m so happy to be a Birchbox member. It&#8217;s been about five months since I began my membership and I think it&#8217;s been worth it. I&#8217;m behind on my reviews but stay with me. There are more to come! This first box was a big win. My favorite item ended up being the hair oil. I least liked the shaving cream.</p>

<p>Now is the time to grab you debit card and buy both of the <a href="http://www.target.com/c/beauty-box-ways-to-shop/-/N-54wll?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Target Beauty Boxes</a>! They&#8217;re up live for back to college and are GREAT deals. I purchased both and an extra one for my sister-in-law who starts back at college in the Fall.</p>
<p>The Target Beauty Boxes are basically Target&#8217;s response to the beauty box fad. They highlight different beauty products and release boxes at different times of the year. I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s a schedule but I saw a link on a forum (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">BeautyBoxes</a>) I follow on Reddit. Here is what is included in each individual box:</p>
<h3>Back To College Honor Roll Box (pictured above)</h3>
<p>This box is my favorite of the two. It includes a lot of products I&#8217;ll use on a regular basis. It&#8217;s also the one I bought my sister-in-law. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s included:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/the-bathery-delicate-sponge-assorted/-/A-14775667#prodSlot=_1_8?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Bathery Delicate Pouf</a>, $1.99, full size</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/john-frieda-luxurious-volume-7-day-volume-in-shower-treatment-4-oz/-/A-16601228#prodSlot=_1_6?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">John Frieda Luxurious Volume 7-Day Treatment</a>, 1 ounce, sample size, $2.25</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/olay-fresh-cooling-white-strawberry-mint-outlast-body-wash-23-6oz/-/A-13509125?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Olay White Strawberry Body Wash,</a> 3 ounces, sample size, $0.99</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/nyx-butter-gloss/-/A-14723529#prodSlot=_1_11?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">NYX Butter Gloss Strawberry Parfait</a>, full size, $4.99 (it might be a tad bit smaller)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/goody-17ct-ouchless-4mm-black-elastic/-/A-11895555#prodSlot=_1_9?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Goodie Ouchless Elastics</a>, 3 bands, $0.99</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/cover-girl-1-floz-clear-makeup-setters-and-primers/-/A-17295396#prodSlot=_1_10?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">CoverGirl Outlast All-Day Primer</a>, full size, $9.79</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/burt-s-bees-facial-cleansing-towelettes-white-tea-extract-30-count/-/A-13729237#prodSlot=_1_4?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Burt&#8217;s Bees White Tea Facial Wipes</a>, 10 wipes, $2.99</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a total of $23.99 worth of products for only $5! I personally would spend $5 alone on an NYX butter gloss. I think that&#8217;s what caught my eye first. I like that there&#8217;s the perfect mix of makeup items and skincare/hair items. You can never have enough bath poufs, body wash, or elastics! This is an excellent deal and  comes with free shipping. You can order it <a href="http://www.target.com/p/target-beauty-box-back-to-college-honor-roll-box-20-value/-/A-21423545#?lnk=Grid_julybb_0713_X0Y0W4|X0Y0W4|T:Template_Grid1A|C:CMS&amp;intc=2676054|null&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">here</a>. Act quick though, these sell out quick!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Back To College: Head of the Class Box (pictured above)</h3>
<p>Even though I won&#8217;t use a few of the items like the fashion tape and the pumice stone, I think this kit is still a steal. The mascara and Covergirl lip color are what sold me. Here&#8217;s what it includes:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/goody-17ct-ouchless-4mm-black-elastic/-/A-11895555#prodSlot=_1_9?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Goody Ouchless Effects</a>, 3 bands, $0.99</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/the-bathery-luxury-pumice/-/A-14266668#prodSlot=_1_13?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Bathery Pumice Stone</a>, full size, $1.99</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/hollywood-fashion-secrets-fashion-tape-36-ct/-/A-16587929#prodSlot=_1_7?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Hollywood Fashion Tape</a>, sample size, $4</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/covergirl-colorlicious-lip-gloss/-/A-15334470#prodSlot=_1_15?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Covergirl Colorlicious Lip Gloss</a>, full size, $5.99</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/wet-n-wild-mega-volume-plus-mascara-black/-/A-16601547#prodSlot=_1_12?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">wet n&#8217; wild Max Volume Plus Mascara</a>, full size, $4.99</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/herbal-essences-wild-naturals-illuminating-dry-oil-spray-2-8oz/-/A-16601144#prodSlot=_1_14?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Herbal Essences Wild Natural Illuminating Dry Oil Spray</a>, full size, $5.99</p>
<p><a href="http://www.target.com/p/yes-to-cucumbers-face-towelettes-10-ct/-/A-13051305#prodSlot=_1_3?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Yes to Cucumbers Facial Wipes</a>, 10 count, $2.99</p>
<p>This box has a total of $26.94 worth of products! Even though the value is higher, I still liked the other better because I&#8217;ll use more of the products. I&#8217;m not sure what the hair oil will be like. I use a lot of other brands like <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/shop/beauty-protector-protect-and-oil?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Beauty Protector</a> and Bumble and Bumble so I may end up giving it away. I do, however, like the Covergirl lipgloss. I&#8217;m curious what color will come. Again, you can purchase this box <a href="http://www.target.com/p/target-beauty-box-back-to-college-head-of-the-class-20-value/-/A-21423546#?lnk=Grid_julybb_0713_X0Y0W4|X0Y0W4|T:Template_Grid1A|C:CMS&amp;intc=2676054|null&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">here</a> but order quickly! They may sell out by tonight! Each comes with FREE SHIPPING.</p>
<h3>Which box sounds the best to you? Are you going back to college? Would you like one of these in your mailbox?</h3>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>
