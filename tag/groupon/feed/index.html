There is a big waterslide and two different tiers to the pool. (My little sister stayed here on her honeymoon!) The entire space is held in a large open-window building and it&#8217;s very warm in there. It&#8217;s one of my favorite pools to go when in the Smokies.</p>

<p>When no one was looking we took turns going down on the waterslide our stomachs and laughing a lot. It was a pretty fast slide. Afterwards, we ran back to the room, got ready, and were on our way.</p>

<p>Instead of heading straight to our bed and breakfast in Waynesville, North Carolina, we drove down the hill and hit the main strip in <a href="http://www.gatlinburg.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Gatlinburg</a>. There are all different types of shops and quirky attractions.</p>
<h5>Dustin described it as a weird fair that happens all year long.</h5>
<p>Gatlinburg is one of those places that you either love or hate. I&#8217;ve been coming here since I was an itty bitty girl so I have fond memories here. We vacationed a lot in the area around with both sets of my grandparents. I love the odd shops like the Beef Jerky outlet and Ripley&#8217;s Believe It Or Not Museum. It also doesn&#8217;t hurt that the scenery is beautiful.</p>

<h1>The Donut Friar, Gatlinburg, Tennessee</h1>
<p>It was raining. That put a damper on our day. Most of the shopping is outside. So we ate at Subway and then walked around to the different shops. I insisted we stop at <a href="http://www.thevillageshops.com/donutfriar.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Donut Friar</a>. This shop has THE BEST donuts in the world. Dustin later said he wasn&#8217;t impressed.</p>
<h5>I almost murdered him.</h5>
<p>He got to eat much more than I did. I only had a little bite because of my new diet.</p>
<p>Each donut is made fresh in the morning and the little shop is located in <a href="http://www.thevillageshops.com/donutfriar.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Village</a>. There is also a lovely coffee shop right down the way but the line was too long and we had to get going.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1228" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6468" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6468-e1468804718976.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>Dino approves.</p>
<p>Other places we visited included random shops,<a href="http://www.bootleggerswine.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"> bootleggers homemade wine shop</a>,  and <a href="http://olesmoky.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">the moonshine distillery</a>. Both offer free samples, which is really neat. We don&#8217;t drink a lot, but don&#8217;t mind having a try while on vacation. Our favorite was the Strawberry Wine and Java Moonshine! I also bought a bright pink sweatshirt for $10 that says &#8220;Gatlinburg.&#8221; Dustin thought it looked kinda silly because it was so bright but I loved it!</p>
<h1>Clingman&#8217;s Dome, Great Smokey Mountains National Park</h1>
<p>With the donut as our energy (JK, we actually ate a healthy lunch), we drove up to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/clingmansdome.htm?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Clingman&#8217;s Dome</a>. This is part of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park and is located at the top of a mountain. You drive up the mountain and then go on a narrow road. At the top there is a small visitor&#8217;s center, port-a-pots, and a 1/2 mile hike to the top. On this day, it was very rainy and foggy. In fact, when we got to the place to park we couldn&#8217;t even see out. I remembered coming here as a girl and it was really awesome. Unfortunately we didn&#8217;t get a peek at the sights the entire time.</p>
<p>Even though it was sleeting we decided to hike to the top. It was only 1/2 mile so it couldn&#8217;t be hard, right? Oh my! It was a challenge. It was straight up the entire time. My legs were very tired and I had to stop a few times. It was frustrating because I&#8217;ve been working out and trying to get in shape. But, we made it to the top and it didn&#8217;t take too long, just a few short breaks.</p>

<p>The dome itself is pretty neat. Once you&#8217;re at the top you&#8217;re supposed to be able to see over 100 miles on a good day. For us, we could only see a few feet. It was foggy and cold. We still enjoyed the physical challenge though&#8230;and met some Christians who were climbing to the top to praise Jesus. That was really cool. We got back in the car and went on our way to Waynesville, North Carolina which took us about an hour and a half from Gatlinburg.</p>
<h1>The Yellow House Bed and Breakfast, Waynesville, North Carolina</h1>
<p>We arrived at <a href="http://www.theyellowhouse.com/index.htm?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Yellow House</a> at about 4:00pm. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/two-nights-at-the-yellow-house-on-plott-creek-road/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Last year we found this adorable bed and breakfast on Groupon</a>. We saw they were having another deal so we bought another. The stay was $200 for two nights. It was a steal!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1229" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6470" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6470-e1468805460962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>Shawn, the host, showed us to our room which was located inside the main house. Last year when we stayed we stayed in a separate suite by the upper pond. (<a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/two-nights-at-the-yellow-house-on-plott-creek-road/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">CLICK HERE</a> to see our trip last year.) The room we had picked this time was the Montecito. The room was lovely. The bed was super cozy and I loved the decor.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1255" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="IMG_6544" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-23x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 23w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524-300x400.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6544-e1468805642524.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>I liked that the room had charm but felt modern and super neat. The room was located on the second floor. Like last year, Shawn showed us around and made sure we knew where the snacks in the butler&#8217;s pantry were. Dustin made sure to get lots of fresh cookies. I wasn&#8217;t feeling too great and neither was Dustin when we arrived. We had some snacks at the wine and cheese reception but then headed back to our room. Surprisingly, we stayed in the room the entire night. I had thought we&#8217;d go to <a href="http://sweetonionrestaurant.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Sweet Onion</a>, a restaurant I loved from last time, but it was closed since it was a Sunday.</p>

<p>I took a bath and put on one of their cozy robes. We ate some food we brought in the room and also had some snacks that were free. The mini fridge was stocked with drinks, which was a nice touch. I loved the included bath salts which smell so heavenly. Some of the games we played were Chinese Checkers and 3/13.</p>

<p>In the evening we turned on the fireplace. I loved sitting in the big overstuffed floral chair and reading. So did Dustin. Our room also had a coffee maker so we made some tea for me and coffee for him. It was very relaxing and cozy.</p>
<h5>I think we were both shocked when we went to bed at 10:30pm! (There are no TV&#8217;s in the rooms. There is wifi, but you&#8217;re encouraged to just connect with others).</h5>
<p>Another cool aspect of the room was that there was music playing through a sound system that&#8217;s wired throughout the house. You can turn it off or up/down. I liked the jazz and classical sounds. It made the experience feel extra special. We had our own private bath and toilet which was nice as well.</p>

<p>Our room was rounded and there were windows all around the bed. You can see in this image where the room was:</p>

<p>Our bed was between the three windows in the back which are poking out. It was adorable. The next morning we awoke for breakfast on the patio and a full day in Asheville!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been awhile since I&#8217;ve revisited and finished writing about our southern road trip that we took at the beginning of this cram-packed summer. If you forget all we did or want a recap, check out my <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/a-southern-road-trip/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">overview post</a>, which links to each day individually.</p>
<h4>If you&#8217;re here just to see awesome pictures of our biplane ride, keep scrolling!</h4>
<p>Sunday, May 31st we left <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/two-nights-at-the-yellow-house-on-plott-creek-road/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">The Yellow House</a>, a quaint bed and breakfast in North Carolina and headed back to Pigeon Forge for our last night on our road trip. As usual, I was looking over <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/a371a6e5-ba68-419b-8dae-d4fdaf10c876?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Groupon</a> and found a bunch of different things to do. The thing that kept hitting me was a biplane ride. Of course I talked Dustin into letting me buy us tickets. After a quick call to the pilot, we determined a time and drove to the Pigeon Forge airport.</p>
<h4><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-822" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic-1024x678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="mainplanefirstpic" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic-768x509.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mainplanefirstpic-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></h4>
<p>The deal we purchased was $79 for a 15 minute biplane ride for two people. I called ahead to make sure we could redeem it that day and then purchased it with my debit card online. The owner, <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/knoxville/life/former-sailor-takes-to-the-sky-in-historic-biplane_95698627?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Marc Hightower</a>, (click on the link for a cool post about him) was welcoming and personable. He explained that business was slow and he decided to do a <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/a371a6e5-ba68-419b-8dae-d4fdaf10c876?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Groupon</a> to get more business and get his name out there.</p>

<p>In the short time we spent with him, we learned he had rebuilt this  1927 Waco Model 10 himself. It was fascinating to hear that he flies it from Key West every summer to offer rides in the Smokies. His life was just as interesting. He had lived on a boat, owned a postcard store, and currently lived in Key West. Marc took the pictures you see of us with the vintage plane. Don&#8217;t let the smile fool you&#8230;I was terrified!</p>
<p>The company he owns is called <a href="http://www.skyhighairtours.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Sky High Air Tours</a>. You can see pictures of his plane and learn more about it there.</p>

<p>We brought our camera to get lots of pictures in the air. Takeoff was simple and so was the landing. The thing that surprised me the most was how loud and windy it was. After awhile you became used to the noise and it became really cozy and relaxing. Honestly, I could see taking a nap while flying! Marc was nice enough to give us hair ties (yes, Dustin too) so that our hair didn&#8217;t get in knots.</p>

<p>We both had headsets on so we could hear Marc communicating with the other planes and the airport before lifting off. It was really interesting. Dustin&#8217;s had a microphone and mine didn&#8217;t. While in the air the pilot gave us a tour, explaining the different sites.</p>

<p>Taking the bi-plane ride was one of the coolest things we&#8217;ve done together. It was really neat that it was vintage and restored. Overall I&#8217;d say it was romantic and the perfect touch to end out trip down south. The next place we stayed at wasn&#8217;t a good experience. I&#8217;ll write about that next.</p>
<h3>Would you do a bi-plane ride? Have you?</h3>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
