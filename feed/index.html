<p>It&#8217;s so funny&#8230;because sometimes I forget that Isabella has a Hemangioma. At one point in time it dominated first impressions and pictures. Today, it&#8217;s a small mark that can only be seen if you&#8217;re looking for it&#8230;or if her hair is ruffled a certain way. </p>



<p>You see, Bella was born a micropreemie. She weighed ONE pound and SEVEN ounces. That&#8217;s it. At first, you couldn&#8217;t notice the Hemangioma at all on her scalp, but as she grew, it grew too. I&#8217;ve written a long post about Hemangiomas and what they are here, but the short and sweet answer is this: </p>



<p>&#8220;A hemangioma (he-man-jee-O-muh) is a bright red birthmark that shows up at birth or in the first or second week of life. It looks like a rubbery bump and is made up of extra blood vessels in the skin.&#8221;Mayo Clinic </p>

<p>As soon as I found out I was expecting a baby I began pinning all different ideas to Pinterest. Regardless of the gender, I knew I</p>



<p>1.) Wanted the nursery to have a lot of white and neutrals in it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2.) Wanted to simplify the space and make it a relaxing oasis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3.) Wanted my amazing sister, Kayley, to sew a custom quilt for my little one.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8895.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2592" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8895.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8895-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8895-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<p>I had pinned ideas for both boys and girls. Later, once we found out we were expecting a sweet little girl, I zeroed in on different ideas. After a lot of thought and planning, Dustin and I decided to go with a simple, traditional nursery with gold, pink, and florals.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8897.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2594" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8897.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8897-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8897-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<p>Ideas that we decided against included: bohemian, Kate Spade, wooden &#8220;adventure&#8221;, and damask.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8896.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2593" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8896.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8896-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8896-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<p>I don&#8217;t like a lot of clutter. I have anxiety and things thrown about can trigger stress for me. I like whites, clean lines, and lots of storage! I wanted the space to look like a baby&#8217;s room, but I also wanted the dresser and other large ticket items to grow with Isabella. I think that it&#8217;s important for kids to decorate their own space, but I know for now, the space is more for mommy and daddy, and not so much Bella, so we did what we would enjoy best.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It ended up amazing. The space is EXACTLY what I dreamed of. I think it has a lot of character and is classic, yet fun for a baby girl. In these picture we haven&#8217;t hung all the artwork on the walls yet, or accents (like above the crib), but you can see where it&#8217;s headed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will also be using this space in the future as we do foster/adopt. The space is Bella&#8217;s, but can also house another little one. With this thought in mind, we kept things like the crib neutral, in case Bella outgrows it and we are placed with a boy.</p>

<p>Above are the images that I pinned that really inspired me. I loved the idea of mixing florals with white and grays. Of course you always need a lil bling, so I worked in strategic gold accents.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Beginning Stages</h2>

<p>The process was&#8230;.a process! We used the room to store a lot of mix/match things until we had the time to get organized and make it ours. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4973.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2555" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4973.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4973-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4973-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /><figcaption>After the amazing shower </figcaption></figure>



<p>We were so blessed by my sister, family, and friends with a lot of generous items for Bella. I ended up being hospitalized only 2 days after my shower, so we had to come back and re-organize it later. </p>

<p>Above, you can see we certainly organized and decorated in stages. Have your little one in the NICU for over 100 days makes it hard to finish a nursery. So many people helped us. We had such great support. <br></p>



<h2>It&#8217;s Finished. (Mostly) </h2>



<p>Today, almost 11 months after our emergency c-section and delivery 3 months early&#8230;the nursery is mostly DONE! Since Isabella has a gtube and other health concerns, she sleeps in our room, BUT, this space is heavenly. I walk in and touch everything. It smells so fresh and clean and baby-ish. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had this post in &#8220;draft&#8221; for so long! Today the room looks so different, but I wanted to post it anyway since it is so fun! </p>

<p>Honestly, it&#8217;s hard to imagine it&#8217;s taken so long to get these thoughts out of my head&#8230;but when you have a little one that has a lot of needs&#8230;heck&#8230;if you just have a little one&#8230;you get it. I&#8217;ve begun writing a post about Isabella&#8217;s &#8220;other 2 NICU moms&#8221; a thousand times but every time it just doesn&#8217;t seem to do them justice. So, with nurses week and Mother&#8217;s Day upon us and the fact that Bella is successfully napping in her crib, I thought I&#8217;d take a stab at it once more. </p>



<h2>How Do You Thank Someone Who Literally Sustains/Loves/Cares for Your Baby As Their Own?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7125.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2725"/><figcaption>She loves them..even though her face looks smug! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Candy, cards, mugs&#8230;these small gifts seem so humble compared to the immeasurable love and support Nicole and Jackie have given our family. Writing a quick Facebook post for Nurses Week also pales in comparison. You see, these two women, one my age, and one younger, literally acted as mothers to Bella while staying in the NICU for 3 1/2 months. Jackie and Nicole are among the brightest, most professional, kindest, calmest, amazing women/nurses/people you will ever meet. </p>



<h2>Jackie Taught Us Details</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7003.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2738"/><figcaption>Jackie helping us with Bella before discharge. </figcaption></figure>



<p>At only two days old, Jackie signed up to &#8220;primary&#8221; us. This means she choose to care for Isabella and our family when she was on her shift at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Before I even could hold my baby she was able to change her diapers, apply Aquaphor to her translucent skin, talk to her, and love her as an excellent nurse would. </p>



<p>You see, in many cases with preemies, the mom is unable to go with the baby to the NICU. In our case I had to stay behind at another hospital for 3 days and be monitored because of my health. While away, I missed out on precious moments with Bella and lived through snapshots on Dustin&#8217;s phone and stories from my family who were there to see her. </p>

<h4>All the while I was pumping/trying to pee without crying/learning to hobble around my room/etc. a woman that was a stranger had chosen to love our family and along with others was providing the best care I could possibly imagine for my 1 pound 7 ounce little girl. </h4>



<p>I didn&#8217;t even know her name. But a week after the delivery and the day (or 2 it blurs together) after we moved into Isabella&#8217;s private NICU room I found out she would be consistently caring for our sweet girl. </p>



<p>She has chosen us and I was honored that a nurse of her expertise in small babies would dedicate so much of her knowledge and energy to my newborn. But, honestly, I assumed she would give so much to little Bella. What I didn&#8217;t realize as how much she would give to ME.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7006.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2740"/><figcaption>Jackie encouraging Bella to pass her carseat test</figcaption></figure>



<p>Jackie is someone that pushes herself in everything she does. She is knowledgable, quick witted, kind, and to-the-point. Along with being a registered nurse, she strives to achieve other certifications, including Kangaroo Care! As I spent days learning to care for an extremely fragile infant, I got to know Jackie and learned a little bit about her and what made her passionate for the NICU. Her little brother had had cancer and although he had overcome it, the impact had weighed heavily on her. She strived to make an impact in other&#8217;s lives and ended up getting a position with the top NICU (where we were) and within the same hospital her little brother had been cared for years earlier. I loved her. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_8981-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2728"/><figcaption>Jackie holding Bella post-NICU </figcaption></figure>



<p>I loved talking with her and it was so refreshing to learn the best &#8220;do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts&#8221; within the NICU walls. The little room on the 7th floor holding that itty bitty baby became a sanctuary for me. As I asked questions, I began building my confidence as a mom. I learned what each number on the monitor meant and even how to attach the leads for Bella if they fell off (with the approval of the nurses). I memorized her schedule and even helped take her temperature or lower/raise her isolette.  Of course Jackie was a busy lady. She didn&#8217;t have a second to grab a bite to eat most shifts, (let alone play cards <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) and I would watch in shock as she ran back and forth between patient rooms and answered to patient calls. She was kind, yet confident and knew what needed to be done to achieve the best health for those babies. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_5416.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2742"/><figcaption>Jackie, teaching me to give Bella a &#8220;bath&#8221; </figcaption></figure>



<h4>Although we became friends, I always knew that her job as a nurse came first and she was so prompt and exact. I constantly was impressed by her professionalism and love for those babies. </h4>



<p>I remember vividly Jackie helping me with Bella&#8217;s feed through her OG (feeding tube through her mouth). We were discussing something and one of the rooms began to code. Minutes earlier the team making rounds had been in our room, going over Bella&#8217;s care, laughing at my jokes, and talking about local things to do. My heart always panicked when I&#8217;d hear our neighbors in trouble and I&#8217;d always sigh a sigh of relief it wasn&#8217;t Bella, but then push back tears for the other moms. Jackie stopped mid sentence and was laser focused. She ran (along with the other team members who had traveled to the next room) to the room where the alarm was going off. I could tell each and every team member was ready to save a life. Thankfully, this was a misunderstanding and a new parent or grandparent pushed the wrong call button. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_8986.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2724"/><figcaption>Jackie (pregnant) &amp; I post NICU </figcaption></figure>



<h4>Seeing this made me so confident that if something happened to our Bella, a nurse, just like Jackie, would come to her aid and put her safety as the top priority. </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_5661.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2743"/><figcaption>Practicing Kangaroo Care </figcaption></figure>



<p>For Jackie, her job is more than a job. When there were little ones whose families weren&#8217;t present she would spend extra time, making sure the baby was comforted. In those early days she advised me on how to do &#8220;skin to skin&#8221; and to bond with Isabella. As the weeks went on, she challenged me to be the very best mom I could be and reminded me that I was Isabella&#8217;s MOM, even though I had to have assistance to even get her out of her rainforst-like isolette. I couldn&#8217;t even touch her in ways that would cause her to be overstimulated. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_5678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2745"/><figcaption>Bella wrapped in a fun bandana with cute sheets via Jackie </figcaption></figure>



<p>It was a hard place to be, but the encouragement from Jackie and the other nurses helped me to learn about my baby and her specific needs. For the first time I learned what the word &#8220;advocate&#8221; truly meant and I threw myself into reading all about the NICU and my daughters condition. Along the way I&#8217;d ask Jackie questions as she helped me change diapers, weigh poos/pees, get Bella&#8217;s temperature, or give her baths.</p>

<p>Jackie was the one who encouraged me to help give Bella her first &#8220;bath,&#8221; helped me hold her to my breast for stimulation, taught me all about the ABC&#8217;s of safe sleep, and reassured me that Bella was going to be great! Throughout the day/night/etc. Jackie was there in the background, cheering us on, teaching, and doing what she did best, caring for her patient, who happened to be less than 2 pounds. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_5591.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2744"/><figcaption>Jackie found a &#8220;dress&#8221; for Bella and matching sheets </figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the most thoughtful things Jackie did for Bella was make sure she got &#8220;cute&#8221; sheets for her isolette. The NICU uses pillow cases for the bedding and some are not as cute and fun as others. Jackie would always grab fun sheets that would make us smile. They helped brighten our day when things seemed dark and overwhelming. Jackie also purchased some cute Easter decor for our room and went out of her way to spoil us! Bella got many special gifts from her &#8220;primary&#8221; and we made sure to tell her all about Jackie and Nicole. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2215.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2604" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2215.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2215-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2215-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption>Practicing Safe Sleep! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course it was with great excitement and joy that I learned Jackie was expecting a baby while caring for ours in the NICU! I was proudly one of the earlier ones to know since she battled morning sickness and she wanted us to know she wasn&#8217;t ill! As time went on, I was moved when I&#8217;d see her holding Bella and know her little one would be here eventually. Funny enough, her son was the first &#8220;baby friend&#8221; Bella had! Months later, after we were discharged, we made frequent trips back to the hospital and visited with Jackie. She was a beautiful mom from the beginning to delivery and I was so impressed by her ability to continue to excel at her job. Jackie ended up having her son early and spent 18 days in the NICU herself. Her son is thriving and they are both doing great! I got to meet and hold him. The picture we have of us 4 is extremely special to me. </p>

<h2>Nicole Taught Us Fun </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_6592.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2733"/><figcaption>Giving Isabella a Bottle While I Learn! </figcaption></figure>



<p>When Bella was a month old we were transferred to a &#8220;step down&#8221; unit. It was still for babies needing extra care, but it wasn&#8217;t the less intense &#8220;feeder/grower&#8221; floor. I remember our items were moved while we were out to dinner. It was so strange to come back to a new room, but we were so excited to be in a new space AND we were more than accommodating for a baby more critical than Bella to use the coveted room feet away from the control room where all the specialists sat. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_6806.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2735"/><figcaption>Spoiling the Tiny Human with Owl Clothes </figcaption></figure>



<p>This new floor gave way for a new special friendship with Nicole. Jackie and Nicole, as I learned later, had primaried a baby before, taking turns to care for him on a regular basis. As a primary, a nurse gets to know a child that will be in a hospital setting for a long time. This is great for the child and parents because they have consistent care and an advocate who KNOWS the child in and out. If a child doesn&#8217;t have a family, a nurse can request to primary it. Jackie and Nicole had cared for a few babies who didn&#8217;t have families. They&#8217;d spend their own money for special clothing, Christmas gifts, or toys. They were the &#8220;moms&#8221; to these babies, who knew no one else! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_6593.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2732"/><figcaption>Nicole, rocking &#8220;Owl&#8221; scrubs with Bella </figcaption></figure>



<h4> In a lot of ways, Jackie and Nicole knew more about Bella than I did. At first that bothered me, but then later I was so relieved because I had not one, but TWO dynamite professionals cheering on my daughter and my family. This also meant I could learn about her care and help when needed. </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_6234.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2731"/><figcaption>A Onesie I Made For Bella to Wear </figcaption></figure>



<p>So, back to Nicole. Nicole is one of the chillest people you&#8217;ll ever meet. She&#8217;s laid back enough to feel relaxed around, but able to get the job (or in her case 1,000 jobs) done! She doesn&#8217;t drink coffee, which I found/find appalling, (haha) but is able to do all-nighters like nobody&#8217;s business. The first time I met Nicole I immediately had a girl crush. She was fun, outgoing, silly, attentive, and told me that the hospital cafeteria had these delicious &#8220;hollywood peanut butter chocolate squares&#8221; on Wednesdays. Her bright colors and love for owls drew me in. I wanted to have her care for Bella every day and smiled whenever I saw she&#8217;d be in. Soon enough, she actually signed up to primary us with Jackie. I was thrilled. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7049.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2734"/><figcaption>NICU Grad (Later was readmitted) </figcaption></figure>



<p>I told her it reminded me of dating. &#8220;I like her? Does she like us? Would she like to care for our family? What if she doesn&#8217;t like us or think that&#8217;s weird?&#8221; The love ended up being mutual and even after getting pooped on a lot, she still stuck it out with us. </p>



<p>With Nicole, we had her a lot during during late nights and before Bella was discharged. As she taught us to feed Bella, we had more time to talk and get to know one another. As the babies in the NICU become stronger, they need less and less attention from the nurses. Bella&#8217;s care went from 1:1, to 2:1, to 3:1, and even sometimes 4:1 if there was a gap in nursing shifts. This was a good thing that Bella needed less and less care, but it was harder and more isolating because you didn&#8217;t get to see a nurse as much. You learned to do a lot more as a parent, which is exactly what we wanted to do! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7051.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2727"/><figcaption>Owl Bottom </figcaption></figure>



<p>Nicole taught us to have fun. Although she was extremely thorough in Bella&#8217;s care (and ours), she always took a minute to laugh or give an extra snuggle. We adopted a lot of Nicole&#8217;s nicknames for Bella and use them to this day, like &#8220;Little Miss&#8221; and Dustin&#8217;s favorite from another NICU mom &#8220;Stinkerella.&#8221; Nicole and I connected on a personal level and I constantly had to keep myself from talking her ear off so she could do her job! She helped us learn about Bella&#8217;s unique personality. </p>



<p>It felt taboo sometimes to attribute characteristics or just play with Bella in the NICU. The first time I saw anyone ever just play with Bella was Nicole. She had her on her pulled up knees and was lightly touching her nose. She loved it! I sat shocked. Of course our baby could play, but I hadn&#8217;t really considered holding her normally, even though she was old enough. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_6848.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2737"/><figcaption>Happy with Nicole! </figcaption></figure>



<h4>I felt like everything we did had to have a specific &#8220;cause&#8221; or &#8220;medical outcome.&#8221; To just play and relax with our little blessing was surprisingly new to me. </h4>



<p>After watching Nicole, I learned how to &#8220;play&#8221; with Bella. I had always read to her, but for the first time I made extra silly faces and tried peek-a-boo. In some ways I think I just assumed Bella wouldn&#8217;t advance from that newborn/preemie/isolette stage. I hadn&#8217;t spent a lot of time considering her out of her isolette or in a home setting. Nicole helped me learn to imagine&#8230;FREEDOM. She spoke about the future and treated Bella as if she was a normal baby.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_5871.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2722"/><figcaption>Helping Dad Give Bella Her First &#8220;Tub&#8221; Bath </figcaption></figure>



<p>Nicole also shared a love for food. She liked sweets (like me) and we loved bringing donuts and Insomniac cookies when we could. I remember learning that she was the culprit for many of the babies signs on their doors. Each door had a fun sign with the babies name and other information. This made the NICU more fun! When I&#8217;d walk the halls late at night I&#8217;d read all the signs. It helped humanize these tiny babies. Seeing their names written in fun colors with markers was up lifting. </p>



<h4>It turns out Nicole had her own set of markers/supplies and would make signs for the babies without families. </h4>



<p>When I learned that there were many abandoned babies or babies without visitors I became very sad. Knowing that nurses like Nicole loved on those babies made me smile. Bella, of course, got lots of signs made from yours truly. Quotes, pictures, coloring sheets, etc. were plastered all over the door. It made me feel happy to bring beauty into her little space. Looking back, I spent a lot of time perfecting the decor in her private room. It was one of the few things I had control over and it brought me a lot of joy. I took a lot of pictures to remember those days. Thankfully, Nicole let me use her markers! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7043.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2721"/><figcaption>I loved seeing Nicole was our Nurse! </figcaption></figure>



<p>As the days went on and on and on, we began to think of Nicole as family. She&#8217;d watch Bella when we&#8217;d be out and near the end we began staying at the Ronald McDonald house and not in her room. Nicole and Jackie would leave us notes and I knew she was in good hands as they helped teach her to take bottles. Nicole rearranged her schedule just to be at Bella&#8217;s discharge. She helped us get her tiny little body in her carseat and celebrated every step out of the hospital walls. She shed tears with us and spoiled Bella with clothes and toys throughout her stay. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9563-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2739"/><figcaption>Cuddling with Bella OUTSIDE of the NICU! </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Continued Love, Fun Aunts</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1829-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2723"/><figcaption>Bella hanging with Nicole on Halloween! Post NICU </figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking back, what I didn&#8217;t know was that I would rely heavily on the strength and love Nicole and Jackie gave in the NICU. When you&#8217;re discharged you assume things will go smoothly. The worst is over. Unfortunately for us, a lot of trouble hit when we were discharged. Bella was readmitted within 3 days for an aspiration event and ended up needing a gastronomy tube. Later, she developed some severe health issues. </p>



<h4>With the love of these nurses and knowledge, I was able to advocate well for my daughter outside of the hospital walls and get her the care she deserved/deserves. </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4856.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2709"/><figcaption>Nicole, Me, and an ever-growing Bella! Lunch Post NICU </figcaption></figure>



<p>She is still unable to eat at 14 months, has undergone many tests, is on 3 different prescriptions, and has gained way too many diagnosis, but I learned the &#8220;ropes&#8221; in the NICU and recall what Nicole and Jackie taught me on a daily basis. </p>



<h4>Today, I don&#8217;t look as Jackie and Nicole as &#8220;Moms&#8221; to Bella anymore. </h4>



<p>I&#8217;ve taken over all of her care and wouldn&#8217;t want it any other way&#8230;but they still hold a very special place in our family and hearts. I like to think of them both as Aunts! We stay in touch with each and have now added them on social media at my request. They always &#8220;like&#8221; Bella&#8217;s pictures, write comments, and check-in on us. If I have questions I can ask them and they are always there as friends. Both have prayed for us and have become such great friends. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1679-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2746"/><figcaption>Easter 2019, A Year Later! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course it was a huge blessing when Nicole came to Bella&#8217;s first birthday party. She drove over 2hrs and celebrated with us! Jackie was busy being a momma to her little one but we saw her shortly after. Both nurses are still actively working in the NICU and loving others well. </p>



<p>When we met Nicole for lunch a few months ago I found myself feeling&#8230;jealous! I was jealous that she&#8217;d probably &#8220;moved on and had another primary family in the NICU&#8221;&#8230;it was such a funny feeling. I then reminded myself that it was AWESOME that she had more love to give and that we were good and in a different season. </p>



<p>Although I found slight jealousy that another family may be receiving this amazing love/care/professionalism from our nurses, I was overjoyed that they&#8217;re changing lives every day. </p>



<h4>And for me? I&#8217;ll just keep remembering them every Mother&#8217;s Day and trying to express my eternal gratitude for the time when they were both mother&#8217;s to my Isabella. </h4>

<p>Last week we had our well check up for Isabella. Our doctor, Dr. Burns with Akron Children&#8217;s Pediatrics shook his head and said, &#8220;She&#8217;s a miracle.&#8221; </p>

Modeling with a big bow and diaper. </figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s true. She is a miracle. She has come so stinking far. She amazes us every day. On the 1st she&#8217;ll be 11 months old. So very close to ONE YEAR.</p>



<p>We are very proud of her. Her strength and joy is contagious. </p>



<p>One of my favorite things to do is reflect on God&#8217;s mercy and grace. He has tossed buckets on us over the last year. </p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have a lot of time to write a full update, but I will say this:</p>



<p>Isabella is thriving. She is growing and is over 14 lbs. She is patient and always quick with a smile. She loves family and cuddles. She doesn&#8217;t love wearing hats and jumps at overly loud noises. Her grin and two little teeth make everyone smile. </p>



<p>Here are some pictures that we&#8217;ve collected this month&#8230;but first, a few of where she&#8217;s come from. </p>



<p>Below was the first time I touched her. She was a day old. Less than 1lb 7 ounces. </p>

<p>Below she was 9 days old. This was Dustin&#8217;s 31st birthday. I made the cute little sign for her to hold. </p>

<p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so excited that I was able to have time to be creative over the last month or so. Thanks to my amazing husband and family, I&#8217;ve had a little bit of free time here and there to de-stress and enjoy crafting. I&#8217;ve always loved making things with my hands and baking. With Bella, I haven&#8217;t had a lot of time, energy, or funds to do it! For Christmas I received some awesome craft items from generous family members and I discovered felt quiet books as well!</p>
<h1>Jaxson&#8217;s Quiet Book</h1>
<p><figure id="attachment_2633" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3025.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-2633" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3025.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="650" height="867" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3025.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3025-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3025-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Jaxson&#8217;s finished quiet book</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I learned about Quiet Books and became obsessed with them. I started by teaching myself and cutting everything out and sewing it by hand. In the end I learned how to do a blanket stitch, install grommets (metal rings) and follow free patterns. The other things I knew how to do before.</p>

<p>I used templates from the blog <a href="https://www.imagineourlife.com/2012/01/03/dump-truck-quiet-book-page/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Imagine Our Life</a> (thank you!) as well as some I found online and others I freehanded.</p>

<p>In the end, I made the following pages:</p>
<p>Cover Page, Tractor, wheels spin</p>
<p>Pizza Page, Pizza slices with pepperoni can be counted and can Velcro onto right spaces</p>
<p>Ice Cream Page, Stack a fun colorful ice cream cone</p>
<p>Farm Pages, Finger puppets with open/close barn doors, Page for puppets to &#8220;play&#8221;</p>
<p>Dump Truck Page, Dump Truck &#8220;empties&#8221; and you can take rock in/out of truck bed</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2632" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3020.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-2632" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3020.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="650" height="867" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3020.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3020-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3020-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bella approves</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I bound the pages with grommets and binder rings. This way. I can add/subtract to the book. I choose to finish off each page individually so that we could interchange them easier. Believe it or not, I never took pictures of the finished book! I gifted it to Jaxson and forgot to do a video of the book pages. I will have to do that. A lot of these pictures aren&#8217;t or it finished but in different stages. I loved it. It took a lot of time though, and planning!</p>
<h1>Baby Christmas Felt Books</h1>

<p>Then, I decided to make Christmas themed baby felt books. I made a total of 4. They also took more time than I planned! Almost all of these I freehanded but the fox. <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/141706040/Fox-Softie-Pattern#fullscreen?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">I found the pattern here. </a></p>

<p>I really loved how these turned out. I stuck to easy silhouettes and only used embroidery thread and felt. I struggled with binding them, since I didn&#8217;t want to use the grommets or things that could be a choking hazard. I ended up threading them together and tying a knot. For two of them I attached them to little baby links. Of course for Isabella&#8217;s I had to &#8220;sign&#8221; it on the back. Each had 4 pages. They are pretty small. Jaxsons was bigger, but these were meant to be handled by little fingers!</p>

<p>Bella&#8217;s face doesn&#8217;t show it, but I swear she loved it and enjoys the contrast!</p>
<p>I began a baby book (first) when learning but abandoned it because I switched to the Christmas idea. Below is where I began and I&#8217;ll get back to completing it eventually.</p>

<h1>I Got to Bake!</h1>
<p>We have an old German family recipe for lard sugar cookies. Yes, lard! It&#8217;s crazy but really addictive. I&#8217;ve been making and eating them since I was a little girl. We made them with my dad (as always) and I was creative and decorated the ones below.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2630" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2847.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-2630" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2847.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="650" height="867" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2847.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2847-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2847-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Beautiful family sugar cookies</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I also was able to get my mixer out! I made some quick <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/9471/peanut-butter-cup-cookies/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">peanut butter cup cookies</a>. They were a big hit at our family get togethers. I didn&#8217;t make my fun &#8220;twisted buckeyes&#8221; but may make some for New Years Eve.</p>

<h1>Fleece Blankets</h1>
<p>Money has been a bit tight this year! We cut our budget back by quite a bit. Instead of buying everyone on our list individual gifts, we made everyone a fleece blanket! This was fun because</p>
<p>1.) it was pretty cost effective (no blanket was more than $17 each) <a href="https://www.joann.com/search?q=fleece+kit&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">We bought the kits from Joanns when they were 40% off. </a></p>
<p>2.) it gave me something to work on and craft</p>
<p>3.) each was picked out based on the person&#8217;s likes</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2631" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2900.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-2631" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2900.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="650" height="867" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2900.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2900-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2900-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Blankets for everyone!</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Everyone liked theirs. They wash up really well (I&#8217;ve washed mine A LOT with Bella vomiting) and I did a different tie which made the prints switch sides. It was more of a &#8220;in/out&#8221; fold instead of a tie. It helped the blankets to lay nicely. I&#8217;m not sure what it&#8217;s called. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3UgR6rKEoE&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">I used this video and cut the notches. </a></p>
<p>This project took longer than I thought as well. Haha. I was rushing around trying to finish them in time. I folded and tied them with yarn.</p>
<h1>I Got A Cricut! And Used It!</h1>
<p><figure id="attachment_2649" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3129.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-2649" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3129.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="650" height="867" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3129.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3129-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3129-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">My craft/office corner</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Not the best lighting above, but you can see that I&#8217;ve been busy organizing my office/craft space. I&#8217;ve moved it upstairs and in the dining room. I received the Cricut Air 2 in mint for Christmas from my dad and other wonderful accessories from other family members.</p>

<p>I received this tool set (it matched my Cricut) and new mats!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still learning, but thus far I&#8217;ve made mugs with vinyl, phone decals, platters, cards, Christmas decorations, coloring sheets, and more.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2636" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3036.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-2636" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3036.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="650" height="867" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3036.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3036-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3036-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Merry and Bright</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>This fun personalized platter was bought at the $ tree! I used my Cricut to cut permanent vinyl for it. I placed my peanut butter cookie cups on it to take to family get togethers.</p>
<p>The mug I made for Dustin was my first attempt. I don&#8217;t love it because it&#8217;s too big, but it held up to our dishwasher and is fun. I will probably redo one and make the design smaller.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2648" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3124.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-2648" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3124.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="650" height="867" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3124.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3124-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3124-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Village</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I really love the Christmas village I made with cardstock and vinyl. It was one of the &#8220;make it now&#8221; projects. I already had a glittery metal house on my mantel. I added this fun accordion style paper village behind it. You can place tea lights behind it as well to make the windows glow.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2647" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3123.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-large wp-image-2647" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3123-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3123-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3123-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3123-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3123-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3123.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1156w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">village on mantel</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Instead of only using white, I added in blue for a pop of color.</p>

<p><figure id="attachment_2629" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2839.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-2629" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2839.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="650" height="867" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2839.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2839-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2839-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Mistle Toes!</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I saw this idea on Pinterest and had to try it. I wasn&#8217;t crazy about it, but was bored and wanted to make a Grandparent gifts from the baby. I made a big mistake by getting her toe nails dyed green after applying water color paints! haha The cards weren&#8217;t perfect, but it was a free craft (I had all supplies at home) and I had fun making memories with Bella.</p>
<p>You can see I&#8217;ve been pretty busy crafting! This has helped a lot with stress. It&#8217;s been very fun to work with my hands and make beautiful things.</p>
<p>Hope you had a blessed Christmas,</p>

<p>Hello All! It&#8217;s been a little bit! Instead of writing an update on Isabella, I thought I&#8217;d post about how our bedroom is set up for her and her feeding tube! Before we brought Bella home, I looked everywhere online and really only found a few resources for setting up a space for a gtube fed baby that I loved. I decided that having Bella and her equipment (even though it&#8217;s not a ton) could look stylish and neat in our space. So I&#8217;ve worked hard to find solutions that work for us. Of course, it&#8217;s taken a bit, but this is what we&#8217;ve come up with!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1638.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2545" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1638.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1091w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1638-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1638-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1638-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1638-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1091px) 100vw, 1091px" /><figcaption>Our bed! We invested in a Sleep Number Bed and adore it! </figcaption></figure>



<p>She&#8217;s napping beside me right now&#8230;so I might have to make this shorter than I&#8217;d like. When she wakes up, we&#8217;ll have to play!</p>



<p>For context: Isabella is 9 months old and has a gtube. Her gtube is a Minnie One Button by AMT. She is on continuous overnight feeds. She just recently outgrew her bassinet (she&#8217;s 12 1/2 lbs and it holds up to 15 but she&#8217;s rolling). She&#8217;s itty bitty thanks to being a micropreemie and having feeding difficulties!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Isabella&#8217;s Clothing&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Babies with Gtubes may need to be &#8220;hooked up&#8221; all night. We primarily use button down sleepers. We run her tubing through the space between the buttons. Of course, sometimes I love a zipped up sleeper OR we purchased them before we knew she&#8217;d have a Gtube (darn my need to be &#8220;prepared&#8221;). In this case, I take scissors (fabric ones work best) and cut a slit near the leg. If the sleeper zips down instead of up (like in this picture above) we can run the tubing out the bottom before zipping it all the way! It&#8217;s also interesting to note that Gtube babies can leak. Their stoma (hole in their stomach) leaks and sometimes gets stomach stuff on their clothes or you or their bed. In this case, Bella&#8217;s gtube leakage stained her sleeper. The acid in the stomach contents basically &#8220;bleaches&#8221; it. See the right side?</p>



<p>In some cases a baby may need to have gloves to cover their hands from grabbing their tubing. Bella got too smart and pulls her gloves off. We love the sleepers that have built in mittens. She has more trouble pulling them off. But, they aren&#8217;t readily available in larger sizes. I&#8217;ll have to make a post all about the best clothing for tubies later!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1636.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2543" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1636.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1091w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1636-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1636-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1636-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1636-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1091px) 100vw, 1091px" /><figcaption>Our room with Bella&#8217;s set up </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Our Room Setup</h2>



<p>Our home has only 2 bedrooms. It&#8217;s a small cape cod style brick home. We set up a lovely nursery for Isabella, assuming she would spend time in the other bedroom. Instead, we have Bella in our room out of necessity and love it! (I would strongly suggest sharing a room with your baby as long as you can. Some of the most precious moments have taken place in this little room. Lots of memories).</p>



<h2>Why Does She Need to Be In Our Bedroom?</h2>



<p><strong>1.) A &amp; B&#8217;s</strong> </p>



<p>Isabella has a lot of health concerns. When we brought her home from the NICU she slept in our room because she had had A &amp; B&#8217;s (apnea and bradycardia, pauses in breathing and lower heart rates) before being discharged from the NICU and we weren&#8217;t comfortable having her sleep away from us. She was clear of them, or else she wouldn&#8217;t have been able to go home, but we were still a little bit weary of them. 100+ days in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit does that to you.</p>



<p><strong>2.) AC</strong> </p>



<p>Our home also doesn&#8217;t have central air so we would have her stay in our space with the air running. </p>



<p><strong>3.) Overnight Feeds</strong> </p>



<p>Until Bella was over 6 months old we were on a strict 3 hour schedule. When she was about 7 months we went to a 4 hour schedule. Then, around 8 months we switched to overnight continuous feeds.</p>



<p>Before switching to overnight feeds, Bella would be sleeping, then we&#8217;d get her up and she&#8217;d need to be hooked up to her pump and would eat for an hour and then be held for at least 30 minutes afterward or she would vomit. We would pause the feed if she retched and sometimes held her for two hours or longer. This was very tiring. We fed her 10:30pm 1:30am, 4:30am, and 7:30am. Then, we graduated to 11pm, 3am and 7am. You can imagine how much that helped us! Then we switched to continuous feeds which is a win win for everyone! </p>



<p>During the night feeds it was easiest to just have Bella close-by. We took turns doing the feeds while sitting upright in bed. We&#8217;d watch movies on our phones, play games, or read. Eventually we&#8217;d get so tired that we&#8217;d bring ice packs to bed to keep us from nodding off. We could&#8217;t fall asleep while holding Bella for fear she&#8217;d suffocate or aspirate. We both got used to sleeping with the lights on and lots of noise! </p>



<p><strong>4.) Aspirating &amp; Choking </strong></p>



<p>At one point, Bella was vomiting up to 6-7 times a night. We would hear her begin to choke and would run to her bassinet to help her clear her throat. This was terrifying as we practiced safe sleep and she&#8217;d be on her back. We got used to her sounds and could tell when she was coughing or about to vomit. We had extra bedding/clothing/etc. If she were in another room we wouldn&#8217;t be able to hear her and risk not getting to her in time and her aspirating her vomit. We would also switch our clothing sometimes up to 4 times a night since she&#8217;d vomit on us. </p>



<p><strong>5.) Continuous Overnight Feeds</strong></p>



<p>Now, some of the previous concerns aren&#8217;t as prevalent. I no longer worry about A &amp; B&#8217;s now that she&#8217;s almost 9 months and it&#8217;s the winter so air conditioning isn&#8217;t a concern. </p>



<p>We do worry about her choking and aspirating. Although she can clear her throat on her own, we worry she will fall back asleep in her vomit or swallow it wrong. </p>



<p>She is also now getting continuously fed by her Kangaroo Pump. We need to be able to hear if it alerts us to an empty bag or clog. We do wake up 2x a night to refill the formula, change her diaper, and give her a medication. She can go all night without vomiting, but usually vomits at least once during the night (which we hear). </p>



<h2>The Crib</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1620.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2536" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1620.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1091w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1620-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1620-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1620-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1620-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1091px) 100vw, 1091px" /><figcaption>Bella enjoying herself (Toys in the crib since I was watching)</figcaption></figure>



<p>We moved my makeup vanity to make room for Isabella&#8217;s crib. The crib is just basic white and works great. We didn&#8217;t have a lot of room in the space so we actually have it covering my closet. We simply scoot it over if I need in it, which I don&#8217;t very often since most of my cozy clothes are in drawers. My dad gifted it to us for around $200 and it converts to a toddler bed and headboard. We use a Abbot Safety Crib Mattress with a waterproof mattress cover. Bella&#8217;s sheets need changed a lot throughout the night. We use basic gray fitted sheets we were gifted from Target. The fun ruffle is from Amazon, but we removed it because the kitties were enjoying hanging out under the crib during the day. </p>



<h2>Storage Solutions</h2>



<p>We found early on that we needed A LOT of storage for Bella. </p>



<h2>Diaper Caddies Are My BFF </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1615.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2531" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1615.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1091w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1615-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1615-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1615-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1615-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1091px) 100vw, 1091px" /><figcaption>Diaper Caddy Above
</figcaption></figure>



<p>To begin, I created a fun little diaper caddy for upstairs and downstairs. This diaper caddy was a big lifeline and helped me stay organized! I found two gray caddies with plenty of storage from Amazon. Both are almost identical, expect the bedroom one used to have some topical medicines Bella needed at night.</p>



<p>The caddy is packed (and re-stocked as needed) with the basics: diapers, wipes, hand sanitizer, and anything else we might need. </p>

</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>On the sides I pack:</p>



<p>-Topical Medications </p>



<p>For Bella we have one for her Hemangioma and one for her Gtube site. I wouldn&#8217;t ever put oral medications out for safety reasons, especially as she gets older and can reach into the caddy. </p>



<p>-Split Sponges </p>



<p>These go around her Gtube site and keep it dry and clean. We usually use sterile ones that we open as needed. We also have made our own with cosmetic sponges. </p>



<p>-Boogy Wipes</p>



<p>Saline solution wipes to soften boogers (haven&#8217;t needed them!) </p>



<p>-Honest Company Lavender Lotion</p>



<p>My all time favorite baby product ever. I love this stuff and use it on Bella after baths, before bed and on myself! </p>



<p>-Medical Tape </p>



<p>We don&#8217;t use this a ton, but sometimes need it to secure her tubing or her stoma site. It also comes in handy to manipulate the tubing and move it away from her. </p>



<p>-Digital Thermometer </p>



<p>Once a NICU mom, always a NICU mom. She had her temp taken every 3hrs. I don&#8217;t obsessively check it, but it&#8217;s there if I need it. </p>



<p>-Teether/Toys</p>



<p>Sometimes you need to be able to grab a toy real quick to distract or soothe a baby! </p>



<p>-Warm Socks</p>



<p>Bella always would choke herself with her hands when she was younger. She&#8217;d gag and then throw up! We would put socks over her hands as mittens because we went through so many. She&#8217;d throw up on them constantly. So an extra pair served us well. For a long time she&#8217;d grab her tubing, but she&#8217;s getting better about it. The socks on her hands also kept her from grabbing her tubing or the med port attached to the tubing. </p>



<p>-Sanitizer </p>



<p>Would you want your diaper changed and then your mommy feeding you without washing her hands? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We sanitize like it&#8217;s our business. I&#8217;ll change her diaper then give her meds or hook her up to the feed. I use sanitizer in between. </p>



<p>I really can&#8217;t say enough about this caddy solution. It&#8217;s awesome. Everyone who helps with Bella knows the caddy has everything you need. I keep it stocked and ready. Some items have been added, others subtracted. Usually there&#8217;s a burp cloth thrown on top for emergency spit ups. At the bottom you might find chapstick or a favorite hand lotion for me. I also attach those little sanitizers to the handles to guarantee there&#8217;s always sanitizer close by. </p>



<p>Things that have been subtracted: mittens, gauze pads, cotton swabs, gtube cleaning kits, homemade diaper cream, and water wipes.</p>



<p>Things that have been added: cotten swabs, a nose frieda sucker, saline spray for the nose, assorted toys, and a notepad and pen (to write symptoms, important numbers, etc) </p>



<h2>Makeup Drawer Conversion (ALEX Drawer from IKEA) </h2>

<p>You might know from this blog, but before Bella, I enjoyed writing about makeup and beauty products! I have quite the collection (err hoard) of makeup products. Having a baby changes from things and I don&#8217;t add much to my collection these days. I do, however, have an awesome storage drawer set for my things! I kept it in tact as long as I could until Bella&#8217;s things overflowed into it. I actually still have my makeup, beauty supplies, and jewelry in it, but have made room for some Bella essentials. (My vanity is now in her room where I get ready and she also has lots of storage in her room.) These items are only essentials and things we need to grab during the night or morning. However, I could see where if you needed the space for other medical items or general baby items you could put them in the drawers. This would be great for a baby with a vent! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1610.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2527" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1610.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1610-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>My makeup! </figcaption></figure>



<p>I still have my makeup in the drawers, but have cleared 3 for Bella&#8217;s things. </p>

<p>We go through SO MANY sleepers since she vomits quite a bit. And sometimes her gtube leaks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1608.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2525" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1608.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1608-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Burp Cloths</figcaption></figure>



<p>We also go through about 6 or more burp cloths a day. </p>

<p>I juusssttt added a small space for her socks. We noticed we always put them on at night or before her days so I threw them in here. There&#8217;s also a few mittens in there. </p>

<p>Lastly, I place the diaper caddy on top of the drawers and use the space behind it to hide a few things! We always keep extra sanitizer, sanitizing wipes, a blanket or changing pad to change her on, and a few favorite toys. </p>



<p>I&#8217;ve thought about putting pull out drawers under her crib, but I just run into her bedroom to grab her outfits which are hung up in the morning. So there really isn&#8217;t a need. We put extra sheets for her crib in the Alex drawers as well. </p>

<h2>Our Monitor </h2>



<p>As Bella gets bigger, we have the option of leaving her in her crib sometimes without us in the room. I can only count the time we&#8217;ve done this on one hand, but it&#8217;s a nice option. To be honest, Dustin wakes up and goes to work in his office. I keep sleeping in the room with Bella. He brings our monitor with him and is able to listen and see Bella even though I&#8217;m in the room. We mounted our monitor right above her crib so we can see her completely. We absolutely love it. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1556-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2518" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1556-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1556-1-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Watching from above</figcaption></figure>



<p>We bought the Levana monitor from Khols with some Khols cash that was given to us. I love it. I don&#8217;t remember the model. It tells us the time, temperature in the room, and is both color and has great night vision. You can also talk to the baby through it, walkie-talkie style! </p>



<p>When Bella vomits in the morning after Dustin goes downstairs he can hear her and see us. If I need assistance getting her cleaned up, or catching the vomit, or changing the bedding, he can run up the stairs in a minute. (He works from home). This is great since sometimes I&#8217;m a little groggy from just waking up and it&#8217;s good to have an extra set of hands. We can also communicate back and forth. He can hear us and we can hear him. Sometimes he can see her grabbing her tube and making a fuss. Sometimes he hears her coughing before she throws up. It&#8217;s nice to have him &#8220;watching us.&#8221; He laughs that he can hear me snoring and can tell if we&#8217;re both still asleep! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1627.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2539" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1627.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1091w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1627-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1627-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1627-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1627-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1091px) 100vw, 1091px" /><figcaption>Bella&#8217;s view

<h2>Crib Accessories</h2>



<p>We don&#8217;t keep much of anything in Bella&#8217;s crib. I was hesitant about the fish electronic toy, but she used it in the NICU and loved it. We have the one with a remote control. We only set it to &#8220;waves&#8221; at night as a sound maker. She&#8217;s learned to kick it on with the orange button, which is pretty fun. It&#8217;s also nice for her to see when I&#8217;m tidying up the bedroom and restocking her diaper caddy or getting ready in the morning. I would never have a toy in her crib while she&#8217;s sleeping, but if I&#8217;m watching I let her have one or two if I&#8217;m in the room. </p>



<h2>Trash</h2>



<p>We have both a small trash can and a diaper genie. (Both need taking out in this picture). The diaper genie works great and we use it for heavier diapers. The small trash can is used for gauze, tubie covers, medical tape, and wipes. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1626.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2538" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1626.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1091w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1626-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1626-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1626-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1626-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1091px) 100vw, 1091px" /><figcaption>Another view of our room</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1628.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2540" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1628.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1628-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Keeping it real<br></figcaption></figure>



<p>You may see these pictures and think things are too &#8220;staged.&#8221; Well, they are. Although this is how our room looks most days, I do utilize a few tricks to make it look nice. I always stash un-folded laundry on the other side of the bed! I also have a fun robot vacuum and use it in the bedroom from time to time. I try to keep handy storage solutions close so that everything has it&#8217;s own place. That helps because otherwise I feel stressed. Every night before bed we tidy up and every morning I try to make the bed. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>



<p>Also, you may* have noticed my bra hanging on the closet door lol. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1557.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2519" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1557.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1557-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>View from my bed at night</figcaption></figure>



<p>The only thing that is different when Bella is eating/sleeping is her IV pole and pump! We bring it up at nighttime. This is what the set up looks like. If you hate light, you&#8217;ll want to tape a black piece of paper over the pump face. We don&#8217;t mind it. I actually like the glow and pumping noise! </p>



<h2>A Unique Use of Paper Towel Rolls </h2>



<p>Last, but not least, I do worry about Bella getting strangled by her feeding pump tubing. It&#8217;s long. And it worries me. We looked online and our best solution is running it through empty paper towel rolls. Our perfect number is 3! She is unable to wrap it around her neck this way. She does grab them and sometimes puts the tubing in her mouth. For the most part she doesn&#8217;t. The pump will also alert us if there is a clog, so if it was being wound tight around her it&#8217;d alarm us. She usually sleeps very well and only grabs the tubing when she&#8217;s ready to wake up and get our attention! She&#8217;s never pulled her tube out on her own, but had kicked the medical port open once. That&#8217;s for another time. </p>



<p>I hope this is helpful for any other tubie mom who wants their space to look nice! </p>

<p>I wanted to give a quick update on Bella and life. Unfortunately I usually end up writing way too much and over-sharing. For that reason, you can scroll to the bottom of this post for a TLDR (Too Long Didn&#8217;t Read) summary.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Bella&#8217;s Milestones</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2130.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2509" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2130.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2130-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Rolling back and forth</figcaption></figure>



<p>Isabella is doing quite a bit! I have to remind myself that she is only 5 1/2 months adjusted and not the technical 8 1/2 months she is. She loves to coo and make lots of noise. She mimics us and my sister Kayley actually taught her to curl her tongue the other day! I didn&#8217;t believe it until she was doing it the next day on her own! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1742.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2478" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1742.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1091w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1742-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1742-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1742-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1742-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1091px) 100vw, 1091px" /><figcaption>Loving with Daddy</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bella can&#8217;t sit up on her own, but enjoys her sit-me-up-chair and rolls around quite a bit. She doesn&#8217;t love flipping all the way over and settles for just rocking side to side.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2070.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2501" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2070.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2070-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Cuddling </figcaption></figure>



<p>She doesn&#8217;t like tummy time, but we are trying to sneak it in every day. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s because of her gtube or if the pressure makes her vomiting worse.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1920.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2484" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1920.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1920-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Hanging with dad</figcaption></figure>



<p>A new special love is books! Bella loves to flip the pages and look at the bright colors. She enjoys listening to others tell stories. She especially loves visitors of all kinds. Grandma Julie and Grandma Kim are over a lot and spoil her with lots of attention and play time. She is reaching for toys and pulling hair (ouch!). We are excited as she grows and hope she will be sitting up on her own.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1934.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2490" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1934.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1934-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Enjoying a &#8220;Girls Bible&#8221; </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Bella&#8217;s Size&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Little itty bitty Bella is still tiny. She&#8217;s in the less than 1% for her age, but we think she&#8217;s just extra teeny and cute! A good friend found this adorable art piece that fits her perfectly. (Thank you Zara, Alex and Alex!) Even though Bella is 8 1/2 months, she is just under 12lbs. She wears size 1 in diapers and also wears 3 months in clothing.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2042.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2499" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2042.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2042-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Cute diapers from a friend! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Her size isn&#8217;t a big concern currently because her rate of growth is getting better. For once, our dietician seemed pleased with her growth! She averages less than 15 grams a day. Of course they&#8217;d like to see her hit 30 grams a day, but she likes to do things her way.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2128.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2508" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2128.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2128-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Doing things her way! </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Eating&#8230;Starting Baby Food!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2037.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2497" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2037.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2037-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>What is this?</figcaption></figure>



<p>We got the green light just Tuesday to begin trying baby food with Isabella! I rebelled and had bought a small jar of Beechnut baby food to try. (Silly me, I didn&#8217;t realize a blend wasn&#8217;t the best choice until later). Thankfully she seemed to tolerate it. This will be a long process since Bella has such a strong eating aversion. We are excited to begin working with her and will be allowing her to try fruits and vegetables that are thicker to prevent her from aspiration.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2039.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2498" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2039.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2039-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Bellas first oral try of food </figcaption></figure>



<p>Our GI Dietician suggested allowing her to be in control during the feeds. We will allow her to hold the spoon and/or reach for the food. We have to be very careful as to not irritate her or bring back scary memories from when she was silently aspirating and we didn&#8217;t know it. Our goal is for her to just tolerate oral feeds. She hasn&#8217;t had anything orally since we left the NICU in June after her feeding tube was placed.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2013.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2494" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2013.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2013-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>&#8220;Eating&#8221; with Daddy</figcaption></figure>



<p>For fun, and curiosity sake, I offered her a bottle a few times last week. She had no idea what to do with it. BUT she did reach for it and didn&#8217;t cry or knock it our of my hands. She held it and chewed on the nipple. She never latched, but seemed ok with just gumming the nipple. I emptied the rest into her feeding tube bag and let her get comfortable with it. We will go straight to a sippy cup because of her eating issues.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Vomiting&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Bella continues to vomit, but it is getting better. She is doing overnight feeds which are amazing and allow her to get more in her tummy without gagging. She is also taking medications and seeing our local chiropractor, Dr. Matt Beachy. We have seen a huge improvement in her overall health since starting overnight feeds and seeing Dr. Beachy. Bella still vomits 3X or more times a day, but it is much more manageable than 8x!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Synagis Shots to Prevent RSV&nbsp;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1861.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1861.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1091w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1861-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1861-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1861-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1861-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1091px) 100vw, 1091px" /><figcaption>My dining table looks like a doctor&#8217;s office! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Bella gets these crazy expensive shots once a month. It&#8217;s called Synagis and it&#8217;s basically antibodies injected into her to help her fight RSV. It&#8217;s surprisingly not a vaccine. Only certain babies that are high risk qualify. The home health nurse comes and gives it to her in the thigh. Thus far we&#8217;ve had one injection for November. It&#8217;s a very interesting process.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2022.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2495" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2022.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2022-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Medical supply monthly delivery</figcaption></figure>



<p>This also means that we have chosen to mostly isolate Bella to home. We have only taken her to the Grandparents and her appointments. We have limited visitors. When we do go out ourselves we change our clothes and sanitize like crazy. Long story short, Bella has a weaker immune system. She needs protected as a micropreemie and we are making this a priority. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1738-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2477" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1738-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1738-1-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Not so bad at home&#8230;with a fun candle insert my daddy got us! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Bella did get a small virus, but was able to fight it off, almost completely. She is a little congested still but nothing bad. The doctors at Akron Children&#8217;s Pediatrics made an emergency appointment and assessed her. They suggested she fight it off herself and not to give her medications, which made me happy. She had a runny nose, slight cough (which sounded like a barking seal), and low fever. I believe I gave it to her. She seems almost over it. We also had her tested for RSV to rule it out. She didn&#8217;t have it. The doctors are amazing and the one we saw called us that night at 9pm to confirm she was RSV free!</p>

<h2>Mourning A Loss</h2>



<p>Unexpectedly we found out one of my friends, Elizabeth Brown, committed suicide less than a week ago. Elizabeth was a great friend and I grew up with her and her brother. This loss has really hit us hard and we are grieving. As a mother, I now experience this loss in a new light. My heart is broken for her husband, her family, and friends. This has certainly made me think about life and hug those around me a little longer. I&#8217;ve also been feeling a little gloomy, which is to be expected. </p>

<h2>God&#8217;s Love &amp; Friends</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1720.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2476" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1720.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1720-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Bella approves of Sara&#8217;s scripture cards! </figcaption></figure>



<p>In the midst of a hard week. Things seemed to get harder. We are getting hit with quite a few medical bills (go figure). We were denied help because of how much Dustin makes. This had us quite upset and racking our brains for some solutions. (We are very blessed to have solutions). Anyway, yesterday the financial people called and we were able to get an adjusted monthly minimum based on extenuating circumstances. Praise God! But, for awhile we were sweating it out a bit. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1938.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2491" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1938.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1938-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Me time in the morning! </figcaption></figure>



<p>In the midst of this, some friends really blessed us and went above and beyond. A friend delivered a card and a white rose in honor of Elizabeth and my step-sister and her family sent us a beautiful card and adorable Dinosaur outfit! It was also so funny because Dustin went to buy me these beautiful parenting scripture cards from Sara Vrooman (a friend who has an etsy shop) and someone had already purchased them for me! My cousin Sarah had them mailed to me! These have helped me reflect on God&#8217;s love and promises. </p>

<p>These things helped remind me that we are loved. We aren&#8217;t isolated (even in &#8220;isolation&#8221;) and God is bigger than our circumstances. The day the rose was dropped off I had been really sad and was thinking about Elizabeth. Today, when we opened the adorable outfit for Bella we had just gotten home from taking her for a shot, which is always no fun. </p>

<p>Life is slow and fast right now. Each day I wake up to this beautiful, smart, fun, little human in my room. I get to snuggle with her on the couch and see family. Even though she has a feeding tube and some health concerns, life is good. </p>

<p>Today Bella got to see snow for the first time (from the window). She looked surprised at how bright the outside world looked. I looked at her and was so excited over how bright her future is. Even in the midst of heartache and hurts we will keep looking for the silver lining. We will keep pushing forward and living for those teeny tiny small special moments&#8230;what other way is there?</p>

<p>Tomorrow Isabella will be 8 months old. 8. MONTHS. OLD! (5 Months Adjusted)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s pretty crazy to believe we&#8217;ve officially spent more time AT HOME than in the NICU at Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital. Every time I look at her my heart leaps out of my chest and I haven&#8217;t quite gotten over the fact that I can pick her up any time I want to. Or walk further than a few feet with her. Or drive away from the hospital with her. Or insert-normal-thing-moms-do-with-babies-after-bringing-them-home. </p>



<p>She&#8217;s been alive 244 days. </p>



<p>108 of those were spent in the NICU. (The other 2 were &#8220;practice&#8221; haha when she had an aspiration event at home after being discharged and went back to spend more time there)</p>



<p>She&#8217;s been home 134. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be honest. Making time to write is difficult. We spent all day at Akron yesterday and I&#8217;m pretty tired. But, Dustin looked at me and said, &#8220;You gotta write, Tiff. You know you enjoy it.&#8221; And I do! But sometimes it&#8217;s easier to just browse Facebook or Pinterest. Well, not tonight. For now I&#8217;m going to write a quick update. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1534.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2446" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1534.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1534-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1534-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption>Mommy &#038; Me Matching Take Two</figcaption></figure>



<p>How do I reflect on the last 8 months? Other than to sob, laugh, pray, sob some more, and write. Yesterday we spent all day up at Akron. Isabella got to see some awesome familiar faces and she went for her Hemangioma (birthmark) checkup with the pediatric dermatologist. </p>



<h2>She&#8217;s 8 months and is 11 1/2lbs. She is in the less than 1% for her age, but is doing wonderfully. Small but coming right along, on her terms, in her time. </h2>



<p>We always have to plan and plan and plan to make sure we have everything Bella might need. This means bringing two of everything and remembering things she needs to eat via her feeding tube. Her feeds take an hour and a half minimum so we find a quiet, low traffic spot near a family bathroom in the hospital and make ourselves comfy. I used to bring magazines but now I just read on my phone or visit with my Mom/Julie/Kayley/Dustin. I always pack snacks! (More on what we pack for a day at Akron another time). Anyways, my new favorite spot is on the 6th floor of the new Considine building. This building houses a lot of specialists and is brand spanking new. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cpb-location-photo.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2462" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cpb-location-photo.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1200w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cpb-location-photo-300x169.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cpb-location-photo-768x432.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cpb-location-photo-1024x576.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cpb-location-photo-640x360.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption>Photo Credit Akron Children&#8217;s</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thankfully the building is designed with kids with special needs in mind (Thank You) and we have everything we need to prepare Bella&#8217;s pump and feed her while there. We can&#8217;t really get away from feeding her since we live an hour and a half away. We also don&#8217;t take her to other public places so the hospital it is. </p>



<p>One of the coolest things about Akron Children&#8217;s is everything is connected. No going outside! The two buildings are facing one another, Kay Jewelers Pavilion and the Considine Professional Building. The NICU is located on the 6th and 7th floors of the Kay Jewlers Pavilion. </p>



<p>We stayed here with Bella. This was our life. We lived it for 3 1/2 months. We made friends here. We celebrated milestones. We held our daughter for the first time here. We slept here. We watched movies here. We ate here. We did everything here. Inside a building above the city. Beside our tiny daughter as she grew. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/campus-overview-map_road-closure_updated-04-12-18.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2463" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/campus-overview-map_road-closure_updated-04-12-18.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 3300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/campus-overview-map_road-closure_updated-04-12-18-300x232.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/campus-overview-map_road-closure_updated-04-12-18-768x593.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/campus-overview-map_road-closure_updated-04-12-18-1024x791.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/campus-overview-map_road-closure_updated-04-12-18-640x495.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 3300px) 100vw, 3300px" /><figcaption>Map showing Kay Jewelers Pavilion (left) and Considine Professional Building (right) Photo Credit: Ronald Mcdonald House of Akron</figcaption></figure>



<p>And so&#8230;much like Rapunzel in a tower, Bella stayed in the NICU for those 100+ days with us by her side. And&#8230;we yearned for the outside world, too. We watched it snow, rain, storm, sleet. We even saw fireworks fill the night sky. </p>



<p>We would love to hear about what was going on in the hospital&#8230;and loved watching the new Considine Professional Building being built. We would overlook the building adjacent from the large window in Bella&#8217;s room (Our 3rd Room). The window gave us a glimpse into the outside world. The window helped me keep my sanity. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5241.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2467" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5241.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1156w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5241-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5241-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5241-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5241-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1156px) 100vw, 1156px" /><figcaption>Our first room in the NICU. Not facing the new building, but you can see how our room was set up when we did face the new building. </figcaption></figure>



<p>That window gave us hope. Hope to someday be on the other side. Hope that life would go on and we would go on with it&#8230;with Bella. I didn&#8217;t realize at the time that we would spend so much time in that building&#8230;and that Bella would have some additional needs when coming home. I didn&#8217;t realize that in a few months I would be holding her in my arms&#8230;looking out at the same room in which we lived. </p>

<h2>And that&#8217;s what hit me so hard yesterday. We were on the other side. </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1834.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2460" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1834.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1834-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1834-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption>Facing the NICU, in the Considine Building</figcaption></figure>



<p>You guys. We made it. We are on the other side. It was hard. It was crazy. It was wild. But we&#8217;re here. We&#8217;re here and we&#8217;re doing it. We&#8217;re doing life outside of the NICU. There&#8217;s an extra accessory of a feeding pump and some other quirks&#8230;but we&#8217;re going to be OK. Bella&#8217;s going to be OK. </p>

<h2>I&#8217;m letting the tears fall as I type this. I look at this picture and I will never forget. Never forget that room. That small room across from where I sit. Where my daughter began her life. Where we learned to be parents. Where we walked through the the valley of the shadow of death but overcame. I smile. I smile so big. And I cry. I cry so hard. And I hold her and I thank God I&#8217;m on the other side with her. </h2>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure why we made it and others don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m still alive. Or Bella. But I know God is good no matter what. He has always been faithful. Even in the loss of our first pregnancy. Even in the midst of heartache He is good. </p>

<p>And so&#8230;there&#8217;s a thousand other things I&#8217;d like to write, but tonight, I&#8217;ll just post these photos. In the background is the NICU. Having Bella looking over where she once lived has a huge impact on my heart. I am so ever thankful. Thank you. </p>

<p>We began overnight continuous feeds recently and it&#8217;s been such a game changer! Isabella has trouble gaining weight and was once slapped with the terrible diagnosis of &#8220;failure to thrive.&#8221; There are many reasons why she can&#8217;t eat by mouth, but for this post I&#8217;ll focus in on what an overnight continuous feed looks like for us. </p>

<p>I absolutely love the cute Honest Company diapers with the apples. We haven&#8217;t been able to share the wonder and beauty of Fall with Bella outside, but have decorated and used fun Fall things around the house&#8230;like these diapers.</p>



<h2>Getting Bella Ready For Bed </h2>



<p>Before bed, we put Bella in her pajamas and hook her up to her extension set. (I read it was best to attach the tubing to her diaper. I&#8217;ve gone away from that because we change her diaper throughout the night.) What you see here is her Mini One Feeding Tube attached to her extension set. We then give meds and her feed through the extension. The extension is good for an entire week. The feeding bag, which is filled with formula and attaches to the pump, is only good for 24hrs. (Yes, we throw away a pump bag and tubing every single day. It&#8217;s a crazy amount of waste). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-2395" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1174w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1174px) 100vw, 1174px" />
<figcaption>Trying overnight feeds the first time</figcaption>
</figure>



<h2>The First Night</h2>



<p>For the first night I had Bella sleep right next to me. I was very nervous about her strangling herself, pulling her button out, or vomiting and choking/aspirating. Here you can see Bella is hooked up to the pump tubing, IV pole, and extension set. It went amazingly. She didn&#8217;t even vomit! I woke up a lot of check on her but she seemed so happy and content. When I woke up I realized I had gotten SO MUCH SLEEP and so had she. It was crazy. I&#8217;m used to only getting 5 hours, interrupted. To switch to 8 hours was a massive blessing.</p>



<h2>Why Do Overnight Feeds Help Isabella?</h2>



<p>Overnight continuous feeds work well because Isabella has GERD (severe acid reflux) and a premature GI system. She is unable to take large volumes of formula at a time via feeding tube without throwing it up or being in pain. The goal of a continuous feed is to ensure she gets the nutrition she needs. The hope is that the very tiny amount of volume she gets per minute will be tolerated well and she will be less likely to vomit with less in her stomach. It also helps that she can rest uninterrupted. </p>



<p>Of course this is an added bonus to us! We have been on a &#8220;newborn&#8221; schedule until now (7 months) and her feeds were taking us a minimum of an hour and a half. We would need to hold her upright for an hour during the feed and then another 30 minutes to help prevent vomiting. Even then she would throw up quite a lot. To be completely honest we would bring ice packs to bed with us while feeding her to stay awake. We would blare our TV and talk to each other or watch movies. We couldn&#8217;t fall asleep during her feeds and it was very exhausting. At the time when her vomiting was at its worst we were feeding her 8x a day. To do the feed, hold her, prep the pump, etc, it was 2 hours each time. We literally spent 16 hours a day feeding Bella. </p>

</figure>



<h2>Setting Bella&#8217;s Pump, How Does It Work?</h2>



<p>The pump can be set for different rates and amounts of volume for her to receive. For Bella, we give her 30ml of a specific formula custom for her every hour. That&#8217;s 1/2 an ounce an hour. Or, 1/2ml per minute. It&#8217;s basically like an IV drip, only with formula. We allow this to run from 10pm until 9am. The formula is good to be hung for 4 hours. We wake up 2x to refill the pump bag with fresh formula mixed up and prepped in the fridge. </p>

</figure>



<h2>Why Do You Wake Up?</h2>



<p>We wake up at 2am and 6am. At this time we rewarm a bottle and add the liquid to the pump bag. We also check on Bella&#8217;s tubing, change her diaper, and check for leaking. At 2am I also give her a medication that I push through her tubing with a syringe. At 9am (or later if she&#8217;s still sleeping and we can squeeze a bit extra formula in) her alarm on her pump will sound and I will turn it off. The alarm sounds if the bag is empty, but we set our own alarms. We certainly don&#8217;t want to forget to refill the bag or else the pump will pump air into her belly! That can be very painful for a little one. Above you can see that her Gtube sometimes leaks. We have to change her outfit and sheets when this happens. </p>

<h2>Does She Still Eat During The Day?</h2>



<p>Yes! Bella still gets fed 3x during the day. We give her 75ml over an hour at 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm. She gets a little over 1ml an hour. She tolerates it rather well and usually just naps during the 12pm and 4pm feed on my chest. I still have to hold her upright for an hour and a half. Then, at the 8pm feed she falls asleep and stays asleep for the rest of the night. Of course we accidentally wake her to take her to bed and &#8220;hook her up&#8221; but she usually just groggily smiles and then falls back asleep.</p>

<figcaption>Mommy and Me Time!</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>I love feeding Bella. It&#8217;s a very special time. She snuggles up and I have an hour and a half to just be cozy with her. In the beginning I had to do this A LOT (8x a day shared with Dustin). That made it hard to do anything, including making insurance calls and eat. Now it&#8217;s only 2x a day and Dustin does 1. This 3 hours is helpful to slow down and rest. Above is my setup for Bella&#8217;s feeds. I&#8217;m tethered to her and her pump so I make sure to empty my bladder, get anything I want nearby and get comfy! I just finished a fun book called Girl Wash Your Face. </p>

<h2>Overnight Feeding Has It&#8217;s Challenges</h2>



<p>So, sleeping almost all night and not waking up every few hours is amazing. It&#8217;s so crazy awesome. BUT, there are some challenges with overnight feeds.</p>



<p>Bella moves around a lot and can pull on her button.</p>



<p>We alter her sleepers if they don&#8217;t have snaps by cutting a hole in them for the tubing. I run these down her leg to help keep her from tugging on the tubing or getting it caught around her neck. It&#8217;s actually pretty hard to find a ton of snap sleepers that are warm! So, we use zipper ones and just alter them ourselves. </p>



<p>We just recently began running the tubing through an empty paper towel roll to help keep it from away her head.</p>



<p>Sometimes if the button is pulled she leaks all over herself and the bed. We have to change out her clothing and the bedding. </p>



<p>The friction on her button causes her to break out. She can get skin breakdown near her stoma (stomach hole). So we have to keep bandages on it and rash cream to keep it from bleeding. </p>



<p>Sometimes I worry about her silently aspirating the formula into her lungs. If she does it silently after vomiting, I have no way of knowing or stopping the pump if I&#8217;m asleep. I&#8217;ve had to simply give this fear to God and trust that Bella is big enough to turn her head and spit formula out. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-2434" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1424-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" />

<h2>Overall, It&#8217;s the Right Choice For Bella </h2>



<p>Continuous overnight feeds has certainly helped Bella so much. She still vomits at least once during the night or morning, but it&#8217;s not a lot of formula! Sometimes she&#8217;ll go all night not vomiting and will simply wake up throwing up a small volume! I don&#8217;t even have to change her bedding. For us, this is awesome. She was throwing up 5+ times a night before and not gaining the weight she desperately needed. Now, she seems to be hitting new milestones and seems to rested. We&#8217;ve put off continuous feeds during the day, to keep her from being hooked up all the time, and hope we can keep avoiding it by doing this. We can also avoid certain medications to empty her stomach quicker and a GJ tube which puts formula into her small intestine! </p>

<p>Also, note, our bed is made! Thanks to the extra sleep I was getting. I can&#8217;t remember when I took the above pictures, but you better believe the bed is made now almost every day thanks to the restful night and clean bedding with no throw up! </p>
