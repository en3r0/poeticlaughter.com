<p>Only after talking about my 2020 goal list, did I look up my blog and realize I never got around to writing them out! So, I actually broke my tradition of listing and decorating a fun sheet of 10 Intentions for the New Year.&nbsp;(Later, I did find the list, but it was only a few). <br></p>



<p>I actually find this very fitting since everyone can agree that 2020 was a year that was unprecedented. For our little family, a lot of BIG things happened, although looking back I draw a blank since those big things were balanced out with staying home and taking things slow. I thought it would be good and therapeutic to get some things out on paper/type and reflect on things that made up our personal 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5071.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2939"/><figcaption>bella enjoying her new room </figcaption></figure>



<h2>1. We Purchased Our 2nd Home</h2>



<p>We weren’t necessarily looking, but we weren’t not looking. Things seemed to be going well financially and we met with our loan officer to look at our options. We had purchased our previous (first) home for about $31,000 foreclosed and had worked hard to remodel it. Our sale price was going to be $62,000.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_2637.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2956"/></figure>



<p>Since we had purchased it for so low, we had paid a lot on it. We were able to borrow money based on the home selling through a home equity line of credit. This allowed us a good amount to put down on a new home and make some improvements while still living in our current home.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>We thought we’d move in sooner, but after closing on our current home on Edgewood, we realized there was more we wanted to do to it. It would be best if we could work on it while living in our other home on Massa. With the help of lots of family and some friends and a fantastic realtor, we were able to get a lot of the work done within 2 months. In the end, we pulled up all the carpet, laid hardwood floors in almost every room, painted the entire house, got rid of wallpaper, and much more.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1099" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_20200118_100637671.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2962"/></figure>



<p>The home was everything we could’ve imagined and it was so amazing how the process went. The previous owner was very kind and during negotiations we were able to attain it at an excellent price and get a brand new heater put in.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1099" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/19-12-31-10-56-48-2385.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2920"/><figcaption>a historic photo of the home the previous owners had</figcaption></figure>



<p>In all honesty, this new home deserves its own post and much more information, but of course everything was a bit overshadowed by the pandemic and babies! We’ve been in our new home for almost a year and continue to work on it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>2. We Sold Our First Remodeled Home</h2>



<p>Our previous home received a lot of attention. We had an offer after the first viewing. It was a full priced offer! The process was stressful since it was a different type of loan, but we worked hard to make the home attainable for the new family. They also worked hard and scraped and painted all the chipping paint on the outside of the home to make the loan happen!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3058.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2951"/><figcaption>one of my favorite corners at Massa</figcaption></figure>



<p>Our family helped and helped and helped for us to make the transition. We also worked closely with Lindsey Zimmer, our realtor and friend who made it go as seamless as possible.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Our first home on Massa was such a blessing and will always be a special place to reflect back on.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1099" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20-01-31-12-36-20-3090.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2932"/><figcaption>art from our living room at Massa</figcaption></figure>



<p>My last memory is driving up to the back of Mechanics bank on a rainy afternoon. We both wore masks with Isabella in the back. The rain made it hard to see and everyone from the bank wore face masks and had umbrellas. The new home owners were behind us. We passed back the paperwork between gloved hands and individual pens to prevent COVID. It was a very unique situation, but once the check of our profits was handed to us, the last few months felt worth it. We had successfully made a profit on our little starter home and had a lot of people to thank for it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>3. I Went On a Momcation </h2>



<p>For Christmas in 2019, I gifted my sister a momcation to Disney! We found an on-site hotel for only $80 a night and flights for super cheap. It was one of the most wonderful trips. We enjoyed relaxing, eating, and taking in all the magic.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3460.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2954" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/img_3460/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2954"/></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="619" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3748.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2938" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/img_3748/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2938"/></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="619" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20-02-10-06-55-19-3298.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2940" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/20-02-10-06-55-19-3298/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2940"/></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="619" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2913" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/img_3678-2/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2913"/></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20-02-10-08-22-32-3306.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2958" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/20-02-10-08-22-32-3306/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2958"/></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>Going on a trip alone, with my sister, was one of the best decisions I made! I think investing in time for yourself as a mom is essential. We had originally planned on NYC, but Disney ended up being cheaper and easier.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>4. We Worked On Our New Home</h2>



<p>Once I got back in February, it was time to MOVE. We moved into our new home on Edgewood. We continued to work on it, staying up late after Bella went to bed to paint and organize things. We made lists and lists of things that needed done and got re-certified for our home for foster care.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>5. Dustin Lost His Job &amp; Got A New One</h2>



<p>5 days after moving into our new home, Dustin came downstairs while I was sitting in the sunroom and said “Well, I just lost my job.”&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>I thought he was kidding. I was shocked.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>After a few moments, the reality set in. I cried. I was so scared. We had just moved into our new home and our old home wasn’t officially sold yet. It could fall through still. How could we juggle two mortgages?&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Isabella’s 2nd birthday was in 2 days and we had invited our immediate family over.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_4119.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2953"/></figure>



<p>I had spent money on decor, presents, a cake and more.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>We prayed and told our family. That night my dad came over and reassured us that he would have our back no matter what. We wouldn’t get kicked out of our new home. We’d make things work.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Every day felt odd. We were in a new, unfinished home. All of a sudden Dustin didn’t have to work. We couldn’t throw ourselves into renovations because we were watching money closely and Dustin had to find another job. There wasn’t a lot of explanation and letting him go didn’t make a lot of sense. To this day I still think the decision had to do with Covid hitting and mismanagement of company funds.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>With vigor, Dustin set out on finding a new job. He had one month of pay which was very generous. He worked hard on updating resumes, making calls, and spent hours in his office. Of course, at this point, the timing was awful. While still about 2 weeks out of being unemployed the entire state went on lockdown due to COVID. In addition to the uncertainty of the pandemic, we didn’t have a reliable income. Thankfully we were able to receive unemployment and the COVID coverage. We never needed to borrow money from family and our home on Massa sold, adding the profit to our savings. Between the unemployment and savings, we were able to relax a bit. It seemed as if others were in the same boat as us, but didn’t have the safety net of savings.<br></p>



<p>There were a few times where Dustin was close to being hired at great companies&#8230;but to be told because of COVID they had to put the process on pause. It was very discouraging. All in all Dustin spent 2 months unemployed.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_4916.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2959"/></figure>



<p>About once a week I think and thank God we choose to buy a home within our budget and even lower than needed. If we had purchased a home at a higher mortgage rate things would’ve been much more tricky.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>In May, Dustin was hired by a wonderful company. The job included the same pay as he was receiving before except benefits were slightly different. He could work from home and the company seemed to appreciate his experience and expertise.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>6. We Experienced A Pandemic</h2>



<p>The timeline is all jumbled. But, basically, about a month after moving into our new home and 2 weeks after Dustin lost his job COVID hit in full force. Our state was locked down and we were in lock-down for a long time. We didn’t see family for almost a month and didn’t leave except to grab essentials.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1099" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5106.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2933"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="612" height="816" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_4586.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2890"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20-03-27-12-51-19-4703.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2961"/></figure>



<p>The day before the stay-at-home-order, we went to Akron to finish blood work to determine if I was able to get pregnant again successfully. I remember after, we went to Olive Garden and a movie. It was a strange time because we were one of the only ones in Olive Garden and we laughed with the waiter about the “Corona” drink coasters on the tables. The next day, we began quarantining.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1099" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_20200325_164538606.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2908"/></figure>



<p>We did different things to make the stay-at-home order go by quickly. We went on a day trip to Lake Erie and saw 2 lighthouses with family. We’d wave from the windows and sunroof while eating pizza take-out. At times we’d go on drives. We took a lot of walks.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_4792.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2948"/></figure>



<p>On Mothers Day, we drove to my moms and were able to get out of the car. We didn’t touch but went on a walk and exchanged gifts. Things later lifted and then again as I’m writing this are bad again. Our county just got out of “Purple” and I know many who have gotten COVID including my dad’s wife and friends.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>7. We Welcomed Another Preemie Into Our Home to Foster</h2>



<p>Dustin was unemployed. We were stuck at home. We got a call about a preemie who needed a home. There were a lot of details, but not many I can share here.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="464" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/838B6C1A-FA33-49E2-8221-CD87AAA27A2A.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2906"/></figure>



<p>For me, it was an easy YES, but for Dustin, it took a lot of prayer.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>In the middle of the pandemic, I went to the hospital with a mask on and picked up our 5lb foster daughter. She had been in the NICU for 30 days, basically alone. We brought her into our home and loved her as our own.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="464" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/268D3180-ECBB-4406-BA35-4F51DB5B316A.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2915"/></figure>



<p>We had 110 days with her as our daughter. It was one of the most rewarding, yet draining and exhausting things ever. We had hoped to adopt her, but her situation led her to live across state lines with biological family. We were able to personally drive her halfway and hand her over.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>To this day, I get updates and am in contact with her GiGi. It’s a very special situation. I miss her, but understand that she’s in the best possible place! Her family are believers and actually prayed with us on many occasions.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="464" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/800147FF-285C-4585-A98A-FEBC408CC808.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2907"/></figure>



<p>Funnily enough, the day I picked up our Sweet One at the hospital, Dustin was offered his new job within the hour or two I was gone! I had thought I’d have him to help a bit more! He began his job a week later after a week of adjusting to a newborn in our home. From there, I juggled the two (with him working from home, he helped) AND a pregnancy!&nbsp;</p>



<h2>8. I Became Pregnant &amp; Am Past 27 Weeks! </h2>



<p>We were called after my bloodwork in March and told we had the green light to get pregnant! The specialists couldn’t find anything to determine that I would have HELLP again and couldn’t pinpoint any specific genetic marking or syndrome to cause me not to get pregnant.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Since it was in the middle of the pandemic and Dustin didn’t have a job, we decided to continue to pray and wait for confirmation from God. We had no idea we’d be bringing a newborn into the home in May through fostering!&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7330.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2930"/><figcaption>the moment we found out! </figcaption></figure>



<p>After Sweet One came into our life, we realized we really wanted a baby and felt God calling us to try to conceive. I was nervous, but excited. We knew our foster daughter would probably be going to another family member, but had decided we would adopt her if we had the chance. We were ready to accept having both her and our own biologically.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>I’ll be honest, I thought it’d take awhile. It didn’t. Somehow we conceived while having a 2 year old and a newborn within a month! We felt God confirming this blessing. I immediately called my Maternal Fetal Medicine team and at 13 weeks met our sweet Aurora on an ultrasound.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_8990.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2922"/></figure>



<p>I hit my 2nd trimester shortly after we transferred our foster daughter to be with family. This was hard, but a blessing because I was very tired and very sick to my stomach!&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>All my appointments until 18 weeks had to be alone because of COVID. Not until my anatomy scan was Dustin able to join me.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_20201222_144824.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2910"/><figcaption>27 weeks! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Today, I’m over 29 weeks pregnant with Aurora Novella! She is measuring twice the weight of Bella at birth (3lbs) and I feel great. I’ve been taking baby aspirin every day and have a lot of appointments up in Akron with the specialists. Everything seems to be going great and I had such an enjoyable holiday. I feel her kicking/flipping/punching! It’s such a miracle.<br></p>



<p>We will schedule a c-section at 39 weeks (about March 11th) unless I go into labor!&nbsp;</p>



<h2>9. Isabella Graduated from the NICU Clinic &amp; Increased Oral Feeds</h2>



<p>Isabella is completely caught up developmentally! She graduated from the NICU follow up clinic. She is also in the process of weaning off her feeding tube completely. She is eating orally and gaining really well! We are off all-night pump feeds. This has made way for us to graduate her into her own big-girl toddler bed! It’s still in our room, but we are hoping to move her this month into her own space to make way for baby!&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_4625.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2949"/></figure>

<p>I still can’t believe the progress she’s made. She still gets 2 syringe feeds a day of a blended real-food diet, but other than that she eats orally. We do supplement water. It’ll be so interesting to hear what her team says in February! Even if she is off her g-tube, we will probably leave it in for about 6 months to prevent any hospitalizations or relapses.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_4371.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2921"/></figure>



<p>She’s still small, but the doctors say it’s just her size and she will just be petite. She’ll be 3 March 1st and is in 18 month &#8211; 2T depending on the item. She weighs about 21lbs. We are hoping she gains soon so we can switch her to forward facing!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20-01-14-17-14-13-2615.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2934"/></figure>



<h2>10. We Took a Family Trip to Disney</h2>



<p>After we transferred Sweet One, I was sad. We had experienced a lot and I needed a pick-me-up. We hadn’t saved for a vacation, but realized I wouldn’t be able to go on one for a while with the pregnancy. Isabella had gone to Disney at 18 months but had been sick. We wanted her to experience some of the magic and spend some down time as family.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_9561.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2952"/></figure>



<p>With the pandemic, we were able to get great deals and spent a lot of time at our resort! We took it easy and Bella got to take her first flight. We were very cautious with COVID and followed all of the guidelines. It made for an extra special time as a family of 3. I have memories I’ll cherish forever.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_9934.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2947"/></figure>



<p>I didn’t really post or share with anyone we were able to go. It was a very personal decision and we were able to afford it after Dustin was hired. We stayed 5 nights and I’m so thankful we had the opportunity to go once more.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1099" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_20200928_201143.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2945"/></figure>

<p>Wow! That was a lot. Dustin said he reflected on the year yesterday. He said he included a lot of the information, but his was only a few short sentences!&nbsp;<br></p>



<h2>Other notable things:&nbsp;<br></h2>



<p>-We celebrated our 10th Anniversary! We went to The Wilds and stayed in a Yurt. We got to feed giraffes! It was really awesome and our family watched Bella and our foster daughter.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1162" height="776" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC_0249.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2950"/><figcaption>family photos via Alex H. </figcaption></figure>



<p>-Isabella stayed over at Grandparents for the first time overnight! She stayed at both my dads and Dustin’s parents.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>-We hosted Christmas and Thanksgiving in our new home!&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>-For the first time, in a home we own, we have central AC! This has been a dream of mine!&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>-With Cedar Point passes and Zoo passes, we’ve made the most of going! We got to stay overnight at Hotel Breakers for my mom’s birthday and then we had a girl overnight with the kids in Columbus to go to the zoo!&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>-I traveled to Myrtle Beach with Kayley, Jaxson, and Isabella. We met my mom there and vacationed for a week on the beach!&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="824" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_4047.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2957"/><figcaption>2nd bday decor </figcaption></figure>



<p>-After a year, I completed my 2019 Project Life Scrapbook.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>-We were able to give back to different organizations, including our home church, Salvation Army, Circle of Hope International, local schools, Naomi’s Village, and The Faithful Heart Foundation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So much is happening. So quick. </p>



<p>I keep seeing people suggesting to &#8220;write your account down.&#8221; Of course it feels sort of &#8230; silly. Are things really that bad? </p>



<p>Yet, they are. </p>



<p>We are experiencing a Pandemic. Our lives will change as we know it. </p>



<p>We are home. We are in self-quarantine. We only go out to get essentials. </p>



<p>So, I thought I would begin blogging about what&#8217;s giving us hope. </p>



<p>What&#8217;s filling our time. In our little corner of the world. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="612" height="816" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4308.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2881"/><figcaption>I adore our backyard/side yard. </figcaption></figure>



<h3>Cooking </h3>



<p>I&#8217;ve been cooking a lot! We&#8217;ve made some great Home Chef meals and I&#8217;m picking up items to make chocolate chip cookies. </p>



<h3>Outside</h3>



<p>Isabella calls it &#8220;siiide.&#8221; She stands by the front door and begs to go &#8220;&#8216;side.&#8221; We walk around our lot. We have gone on a few walks around the neighborhood. She stops and stares at leaves. There are really pretty purple buds coming up in the lawn. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="612" height="816" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4450.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2880"/><figcaption>My dad/Jutka got her a Learning Tower for her 2nd birthday. She can help me in the kitchen! </figcaption></figure>



<h3>Family </h3>



<p>We aren&#8217;t seeing any family. We went to see my dad, but only through glass. His wife is in Hungary and he&#8217;s been on a work assignment for the last two weeks. It was so strange to talk to him through his front glass door. But, refreshing to see another human. Mom is planning on stopping by at our window today. We facetime with Jutka in Hungary. She recorded her lullaby and I&#8217;ve been playing it for Bella. I&#8217;ve also been able to do Zoom with Sarah and Jess. That&#8217;s been super encouraging. And, of course, texting friends like Aubrie. </p>



<h3>Learning </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="493" height="692" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-22-at-1.32.51-PM.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2882"/></figure>



<p>I began taking a lovely free course called <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2018/02/20/yales-most-popular-class-ever-be-available-coursera?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Science of Wellbeing</a> from Yale University. It&#8217;s on Coursea, a free online platform. I&#8217;ve already completed the first week. It&#8217;s very laid back, yet informative. I took a few tests to determine by strengths. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="799" height="770" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-22-at-1.33.38-PM.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2883"/><figcaption>Top Strengths </figcaption></figure>



<p>I&#8217;m also reading. There are a few books I&#8217;m reading online via <a href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Hoopla</a>, the free library resource. I&#8217;m reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Montessori-Toddler-Parents-Raising-Responsible/dp/152350689X?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Montessori Toddler</a> and a book club recommendation <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sacrament-Novel-Olaf-Olafsson/dp/0062899872/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+sacrament&amp;qid=1584898525&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Sacrament.</a> </p>



<p>I think part of my new personal assignment is to blog our experience. Even if it&#8217;s just for my personal reflection, it&#8217;s good to remind myself of the good good things. </p>



<p>Peace &amp; Joy, </p>

<p>When you give birth to a baby that&#8217;s 1 lb 7 ounces you learn to wash your hands. Well. Or use hand sanitizer. Well. </p>



<p>You begin driving around with a full sized sanitizer in your cup holder and avoid larger public places. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1153" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4034.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2868"/><figcaption>Bella getting checked by her home nurse</figcaption></figure>



<p>So, with COVID-19 hitting Ohio I feel pretty prepared. To be honest we&#8217;ve been in medical isolation for a very long time now. It&#8217;s second nature to our little family of 3. My husband works from home, I stay home, and we don&#8217;t take Bella, our now 2 year old, out very often unless it&#8217;s warm or if the event is worth exposing her to germs. To avoid making this post about my experience and more about tips, I&#8217;ll add a little bit of information that gives me some quarantine street cred. then move on with tips <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="649" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_1923.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2862"/><figcaption>Staying in with these two isn&#8217;t too bad!</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Quarantine Street Cred </h3>



<p>Bella was born in March of 2018. For months before that I was on moderate bedrest (homebound) and then spent a week in a high risk unit where I wasn&#8217;t allowed out but once. We stayed in the NICU for about 110 days. After, we isolated until April of 2019. We ONLY went to needed appointments/very limited family member&#8217;s homes. Dustin and I stayed home as much as possible and when we did go out we immediately took our clothes off and showered. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1153" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_20190503_192517438.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2871"/><figcaption>My first time at Target with Bella, older than a year!</figcaption></figure>



<p>In April/May of 2019 we finally went out, even slightly against medical advice (They would&#8217;ve loved her to be isolated until the age of 2!) We explored all summer and into the fall, even going to Disney World. Again, come October we began pulling in the reigns and have been in a semi-medical isolation since. On March 1st Bella turned 2 and this past weekend we went to a kids event at the library. Although this has been extremely hard, it&#8217;s also been extremely rewarding and necessary. Isabella has NOT been re-hospitalized since leaving the NICU in May and is thriving. She also received immunity boosting injections both seasons. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="649" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_1021.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2854"/><figcaption>Injection information </figcaption></figure>



<h3>Tips That Worked For Me </h3>



<p>So, how did we do it? How did we keep from getting stir-crazy? How did we keep morale up and enjoy (Yes, ENJOY) our time in isolation? I studied other families and dedicated my time to personal growth and hygge principals. Here are some tips that helped me. </p>



<h3>Recognize That You&#8217;ll Be In Isolation &amp; Make A Plan </h3>



<p>As soon as I learned I would be homebound and was considered high-risk with my pregnancy, I jumped online. I researched and learned what had worked for other moms in my situation. I learned that having a plan and routine would save my sanity. I also learned that setting up goals and accepting that I would be at home would help. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="649" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_1938.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2852"/><figcaption>A cup of coffee &#038; my favorite magazine! </figcaption></figure>



<p>I grabbed a little basket called my &#8220;bed rest&#8221; basket and stocked it with medications, a notebook, a Bible, pens, scripture cards, lip balm, lotion, and other things that would be good to have close at hand. I then filled my notebook with things I wanted to get &#8220;done&#8221;. These things included resuming my goal of watching the Top 100 Movies of All Time, finishing a digital scrapbook, and reading 2-3 books that I had put off. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="649" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_5335.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2869"/><figcaption>Reading about other&#8217;s hard situations helped. This book is excellent!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Again, once we realized we would be in isolation after having Bella, we sat down and wrote 10 goals for the year. A lot of these were limited to our home. Some examples included finishing Bella&#8217;s baby book, planning a fun first birthday party, learning about Montessori Education, and organizing my closet. Dustin set out to make money from a blog and learn a song on the guitar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1153" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3352.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2865"/><figcaption>Some great essentials; lip balm, sleepy lotion, face cream, and essential oils</figcaption></figure>



<p>So, what to do if you&#8217;re going to be in quarantine for a bit? Grab a notebook and write out some goals. What are a few things that you have been putting off? Or would like to explore? Once you have a fun guide written down, let it help guide your next few weeks. </p>



<h3>Reach Out &amp; Continue To Build Relationships </h3>



<p>As soon as I learned that my life with a micropreemie would look very different than other mommas, I made a commitment to continue to build relationships&#8230;from afar. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="649" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_1534.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2861"/><figcaption>Bella and I twinning</figcaption></figure>



<p>I continued to text/message/facetime others. I learned to be vulnerable online and in my text communications. I also even attended a few gatherings via Facetime/Skype! </p>



<p>To continue relationship building with other moms, I would ask about their kids, share photos, and pray for them. I also joined the digital MOPs (Moms of Preschoolers) group. This helped me as I received weekly emails and other types of encouragement, like texts. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="649" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_1066.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2856"/><figcaption>This little cutie was fun to stay at home with</figcaption></figure>



<p>As many of you know, I utilized social media to build relationships and to share about our struggles. This helped me build online friends and also helped me &#8220;vent.&#8221; Eventually once out of isolation, I committed to having a friend over once a month to meet Bella. It was challenging since I had been in isolation for a year (or more) but very rewarding. </p>



<h3>Explore New Hobbies </h3>



<p>Exploring a new hobby can sound cliche, but, let me tell you, trying something new can be super fun and energizing! Last Christmas my dad got me a Cricut Explore Air 2 as a gift. Other family members bought me accessories. I was excited to learn a new craft system. The cost of supplies was expensive, but I looked online for discounts and took a few Hobby Lobby runs to pick up paper. (Always using that 40% digital coupon!) </p>

<p>Before long, I was creating cards, decor, banners, and more! I was even able to make Bella&#8217;s first birthday invites myself. I loved watching Youtube tutorials and learning new techniques. When Bella would nap, I would pull out my Cricut and create little things. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="649" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_2443.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2863"/><figcaption>I also created fun little felt books for friends and Bella</figcaption></figure>



<p>This made me happy and I felt good about learning something new. One of my goals was to create t-shirts. At the end of the season I had made us T-shirts for our upcoming Disney trip AND I had made some for friends. Later, once out of isolation, I shared my love of Cricut with friends. </p>

<h3>Learn/Embrace a Hygge Lifestyle </h3>



<p>Hygge is certainly a trendy word and concept! Wikipedia defines it,</p>



<p><em><strong>Hygge</strong></em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">/ˈh(j)uːɡə/</a>; Danish: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Danish?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">[ˈhykə]</a>; Norwegian: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Norwegian?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">[ˈhŷɡːə]</a>) is a Danish and Norwegian word for a mood of coziness and comfortable conviviality with feelings of wellness and contentment. </p>

<p>I learned about this concept through Youtube videos and a few books. My favorite was The Little Book of Hygge by Meik Wiking. I listened to it FREE from the online Library app Hoopla with Bella. This book challenged me to slow down and embrace being indoors. I hung twinkle lights, layered on cozy blankets, read, and lit lots of candles. Hygge became my favorite thing about being in isolation. I made lots of tea, organized my mug collection, and cuddled our infant for hours. Looking back, this time became very special in my memory and I&#8217;m glad I discovered this practice. Learning about it and practicing it can bring much joy and peace. </p>



<h3>Pet Your Cat </h3>



<p>I&#8217;m a crazy cat lady at heart. And in practice. We own 3 cats. Each have their own fun personality. During isolation I learned to just sit and pet them.  (The ones that allowed me to).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="649" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_2934.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2853"/><figcaption>City Kitty, the OG</figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s a strange thing to sit and be still and play or pet your cat, but it&#8217;s relaxing and has health benefits! Some nights I&#8217;d play with the cats and just enjoy them in our home. I practiced having them sit on my lap/chest and watch TV. The cats loved the extra attention and so did I. </p>



<h3>Make Mental Health a Priority</h3>



<p>Being isolated and dealing with Bella&#8217;s health issues was extremely taxing on my emotional health. I began therapy and upped my anxiety medication. Since 15 I have been diagnosed with Anxiety, Panic Disorder, and Depression. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1139" height="854" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_3316.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2844"/><figcaption>Cuddling Bella and Teddy</figcaption></figure>



<p>I remember one day sitting on the kitchen floor sobbing. I told Dustin I could&#8217;t do it anymore. I&#8217;m not sure what I was referring to in that moment, but it was my surrender. I needed additional support. I needed help. Even though money was tight I shared that I NEEDED therapy. I began therapy the next week and continued to go once a month. This hour truly helped me get over the hump of isolation and fear. </p>



<p>I&#8217;m not one for taking on debt, but if that&#8217;s something you have to do to get what you need to be healthy, do it. We were gifted money so that I could make my health a priority. I&#8217;m so thankful we took advantage of the opportunity. Now, I am a much better mother and person because of it. There are many opportunities now for online therapy from home.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="649" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_0816.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2860"/><figcaption>Organizing my space helped me feel good </figcaption></figure>



<p>Also, continue to take any mental health medications. I have stayed on top of taking my daily dose of Zoloft which has helped tremendously. This also includes staying on top of refills. Ask a relative or friend to help remind you to get your refills on time. </p>



<h3>Look For Creative Alternatives To Activities  </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1153" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_1726.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2873"/><figcaption>A fun Date Night in! All the essentials to create a meal together and stay in for a cozy weekend (or months)! </figcaption></figure>



<p>When the world seems dark or your world seems dark it can help to think outside the box. </p>



<p>We were scared with Bella. Every cough or sneeze could jeopardize her life. We overcame worry with hope. We overcame sadness with joy. We sought out healthy alternatives. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="649" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_5172.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2855"/><figcaption>Bella, with the sign we were given. </figcaption></figure>



<p>I remember we couldn&#8217;t get out for Christmas in 2018. I was crying. I was sad seeing others out and enjoying events and Zoo Lights. Oh, what I would give to go to zoo lights! (We got to go the next year!) Instead, we grabbed a coupon and got coffee. We went in our Pjs and drove around town looking at the lights and playing Christmas music. It&#8217;s now one of my favorite memories of that difficult time. I remember we only had a few hours between Bella&#8217;s pump feeds but it was magical. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2371" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Sarah meeting Bella through our glass door</figcaption></figure>



<p>Other fun ideas:</p>



<p>Picnic Inside &#8211; Lay out a picnic with a blanket and fun snacks/lunch. </p>



<p>Obstacle Course &#8211; Create a fun obstacle course with couch cushions. </p>



<p>Facetime Play Date &#8211; Have a virtual play date! Facetime a friend and have the kids say hello and play with the fun filters. * I did this a TON with family. It helped me feel connected. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="867" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2406.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2612" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2406.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2406-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2406-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption>Our little family</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Learn To Cook</h3>



<p>There&#8217;s something so calming and cozy about creating a meal. While we were in, I looked forward to creating meals for my family. I would have my husband watch Bella and I would chop, hum, and dance around our little kitchen. My favorite Pandora station was &#8220;Jazz Dinner&#8221; and I loved filling our home with yummy scents. I didn&#8217;t cook every night, but when I did I would double the recipe so we could eat leftovers. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1153" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2867"/><figcaption>Banana Bread! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Although I knew how to cook before having Bella, learning to cook new things was a great time investment! I would pick out a few new recipes and try my hand at them each month. I really fell in love with Sheet Pan Dinners and Crockpot Meals all over again! As I worked my way around the kitchen, I saved our winning recipes. I have a great collection of winning dinners that are healthy, quick, and delicious. </p>



<h3>Plan A Trip </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="649" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_6597.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2874"/><figcaption>Bella and I at Balloonfest! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Eventually we will be able to leave the house. Whether that&#8217;s a few months from now, or a year, in our case previously, we WILL get to be back among society. It was hard to plan anything with a medically fragile infant that needed pump fed every 3 hours. We were exhausted and desperate to get out of the house. On top of that, money was tight. How could we plan a trip? Why would I suggest this? </p>



<p>Well, because of HOPE. Investing your time into planning a trip is very therapeutic. Whenever life would feel too hard or I would want to get out of our little home, I&#8217;d &#8220;travel.&#8221; I&#8217;d hop on Pinterest or Instagram and indulge my wanderlust. I began saving cool things to do for my bucketlist and had fun pricing out month long trips to Venice, Italy and the South of France. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="649" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_5984.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2870"/><figcaption>Bella out and about with her new (nicer) sign</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although I haven&#8217;t done any of those specific trips since being out of isolation&#8230;I&#8217;ve enjoyed learning about travel and &#8220;exploring&#8221; from my couch. Later, after we received some unexpected money, we were able to invest in a trip to Florida (and Disney World) as a family. I had so much fun planning every little detail and budgeting toward our first big family adventure. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1139" height="759" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0088.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2808"/><figcaption>Meeting Mickey &#038; Minnie</figcaption></figure>



<p>Begin by browsing Pinterest or Instagram. What countries excite you? Is there a place you&#8217;ve always wanted to go? For us, we got to visit Ireland in 2017. We adored it and dream of taking Bella with us again (she was in my tummy while there). I look back on photobooks and also play music from our trip. This keeps my spirits up and gives our family a fun goal. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1153" height="865" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_5936.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2872"/><figcaption>Feeding Bella on the first week she was able to get out! </figcaption></figure>



<p>No matter how long you find yourself in quarantine, there&#8217;s hope. We have a God that&#8217;s much much bigger than this. He will sustain us. </p>



<p>Light &amp; Love, </p>



<p>T</p>

<p>I like to reflect and re-focus each year. A few years ago Dustin and I began writing out goals for each year. </p>



<h4>These goals reflected who we wanted to be and what we wanted to value in the next year. </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="866" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9030.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2788"/><figcaption>Dustin with Bella at Beasts Castle </figcaption></figure>



<h3>It’s so funny how it’s easy to lose sight of your goals and become “responsive” to life around you instead of living each day with intention.&nbsp;</h3>



<h3>Since doing these lists, we haven’t been perfect, but it’s helped guide our years. </h3>



<p>If something has remained on a list for multiple years, we re-evaluate the value we place on it. If something was really easy, I try to them add something a bit more challenging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of the exercise we usually have a good overview of things we want our next year to include.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="866" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_1808.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2818"/><figcaption>Reading great books</figcaption></figure>



<p>This past year was no different. We created our lists and I periodically checked in on it. Once an activity was completed, I’d color in the box and add details. In the past my goals have changed, but they typically include social/financial/creative/physical challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’d certainly challenge you to do this as well. It’s a little different than a resolution, since it’s more of a set of values and wishes. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="866" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5126.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2810"/><figcaption>I used my Cricut multiple times and made a fun hot air balloon shower gift for my cousin</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Even if you just look at it from time to time, it can guide your hopes and desires that God has laid on your heart for the new year. Ask Him what you should focus on and pair that with passions.&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Here’s Mine:&nbsp;</p>



<p>My 2019 Goals&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Some Notes About My 2019 Goals&nbsp;</h2>



<h2>Isabella’s Baby Book&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Completed September 2019</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="866" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0808.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2789"/><figcaption>I enjoyed working on it at a local coffee shop, Nickel and Bean </figcaption></figure>



<p>This was a challenging one. I had wanted to buy a baby book and work my way through it when Bella was born, but with her being 3 months early, a baby book just brought about bad memories. It took me awhile to find a good baby book that I liked and that I knew I could work through, with taking in account her prematurity. I searched and found a reasonable priced one. It took a lot of work to re-record memories, glue in photos, track down milestones, and open myself up to reliving some of the trauma of her NICU stay, but I did it! I’m very pleased I have a beautiful record of her first year (and will add to it) and it was worth the detail-work and effort.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Become a Foster/Adopt Home&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Completed February 5th&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="866" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2020.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2843"/><figcaption>Happy Family of 3&#8230;Wanting more in the future! </figcaption></figure>



<p>We began our foster/adopt journey a few years ago. We had begun classes and was close to entering into our certification. Having Bella messed up our schedule. But, what babies don’t?! In 2018 we did our home study. Hours and hours. On February 5th we officially got our paper certifying our home and us as foster parents. Although we’re not yet at a place to host a child long-term, we are on the list for respite care and hope to invest more time in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Make Shirts with my Cricut&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Completed Numerous Times!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="866" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5365.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2835"/><figcaption>Grandma T-shirt! </figcaption></figure>



<p>I received a Cricut Explore Air 2 for Christmas last year from my dad. My in-laws bought me lots of accessories, too. I began by making paper crafts and worked my way up to heat transfer vinyl. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="866" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_6297.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2832"/><figcaption>Disney world t-shirt for me and dress for Bella</figcaption></figure>



<p>This was fun and new and challenging! Since having Bella I haven’t had much time to myself…much less time to craft. For both Valentine’s Day and our Disney trip I made custom t-shirts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="866" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_3336.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2806"/><figcaption>Using my Cricut<br><br></figcaption></figure>

I was able to make decorations with my Cricut for a friends baby shower</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Read Through the Bible&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Not Completed, Begun</p>



<p>This was one of those goals that I knew was hefty. I wanted to be intentional though and worked my way through the Bible with the Bible app. I got quite a way through, but have more to go. I found that although it was good to read scripture through, I became bored at times and would switch it up with other studies. I still want to continue to read through the Bible completely, not just pick and choose the easy chapters. I plan on continuing the plan into 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Go On a Trip with Dust + Bella&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Completed May &amp; September&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1139" height="854" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20190524_112040641.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2826"/><figcaption>At a petting zoo in Berlin</figcaption></figure>



<p>This was an easy goal, but very much desired! Since having Bella, we hadn’t been able to go on a trip because of her feeding issues. We switched to bolus (syringe) feeds partnered with pump overnight feeds in the Spring. This allowed us so much more freedom!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1139" height="854" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MVIMG_20190524_112743452.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2814"/><figcaption>Bella&#8217;s not too crazy about the big cow</figcaption></figure>



<p>In May we went on our first overnight as a family. We rented this adorable “farmhouse” room in Amish Country. We took Bella all the places we loved in Berlin…the cheese barn, the lil bakery with yummy sandwiches, the puppy store, etc. It was a magical time. It re-ignited our passion for travel. It turned out little Bella was an expert traveler herself! She rolled with all the punches and loved being away (except at night when she landed in our King bed between us).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the Amish Country visit, I had more confidence and bravery to plan a 2 WEEK ROADTRIP to Florida. In September, we drove to Florida. We spent a week at Disney and a little over a week visiting family in Nokomis/Venice. It was truly special. Although we all got sick, I have happy memories from this first out-of-state road trip with my little family. </p>

<p>Also, we got to stay in Gatlinburg and share the mountains with Bella. While in the high-risk unit, I would talk to her and visualize us taking her to the mountains. This gave us lots of hope and joy under scary circumstances. It felt like we’d come full circle when we arrived in the Smokey Mountains.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Try A New Recipe with my Kitchenaid Mixer</h2>



<p>Completed January 20th&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have this beautiful Kitchenaid Mixer. I used to use it a lot more before Bella. I love to bake and be in the kitchen. I loved making Starbuck’s copy cat banana bread. It was delicious!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Throw Bella a One Year Birthday Party&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Completed March 1st&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1139" height="854" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACS_0015.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2836"/><figcaption>Bella&#8217;s 1! </figcaption></figure>



<p>From the moment I got pregnant, I began dreaming up first birthday ideas. I love a good bash and the fact Bella was in isolation made a party that much scarier and sweeter! Even though she wasn’t to be out of isolation until May, we invited a ton of people and threw her a big party. Money was tight so we just had desserts but it was so fun. </p>

<p>I’ll never forget seeing so many people in our little home. There were cars parked all the way up/down the street to meet out miracle. Bella loved the attention and enjoyed opening her gifts. The theme was gold and floral. The same theme for her nursery.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Give Back to Ronald McDonald House and Akron Children’s Hospital&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Completed November&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1139" height="854" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0880.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2809"/><figcaption>Baskets made up </figcaption></figure>



<p>We were shown so much love and graciousness from RMH Akron and ACH. It had been our desire to give back in any way we could.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although we didn’t have much money, I spent time nominating our two primary nurses for the DAISY award. This award recognizes “Extraordinary Nurses”. It was with so much joy I learned they both received this special distinguished award this year.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="768" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7125.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2725"/><figcaption>Jackie &amp; Nicole, our DAISY Award Nurses</figcaption></figure>



<p>Once we were more financially stable, we created gift baskets for families at the Ronald McDonald House. While staying there we were given a few gift baskets/bags. It always meant so much to me since my love language is gift giving. It was a JOY to gather Christmas items to put in a fun gift basket for families.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="866" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0943.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2804"/><figcaption>Bella at Ronald McDonald House </figcaption></figure>



<p>We coordinated with friends from the NICU and brought Bella back to visit. We do this often while in Akron, but this past time was very special because a lot of NICU friends came out and visited. Bella ran up and down in the family visitor space. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="866" height="866" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0954.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2792" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/img_0954/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2792"/></figure></li></ul>



<p>Two years before, I sat eating Thai food at the table she ran by…unable to walk from an emergency c-section and wondering how my 1lb 7ounce baby would make it.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="866" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0941.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2787"/><figcaption>The Success Wall! </figcaption></figure>



<p>There was a “success” wall of children that had graduated the NICU. I would stare at it while waiting on laundry to be done. I memorized the faces and prayed that some day Bella could return and get a photo in front of that wall. I prayed for a testimony like theirs. My mom got a picture of us. Matching red outfits. So much joy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This isn’t done. For many reasons. Time, energy, thoughts, etc. I got very far in writing out our story one night. I cried. I prayed. I read over diary entries and looked at calendars marked with viability stats. I am 95% done. Maybe I like it unfinished. But, I’d like to complete it this year to testify God’s goodness…through all the hardships.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Create Ireland Photobook&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Completed November, Ordered January 2nd&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ok, so I technically completed “creating Ireland Photobook” before the New Year, but I ordered it on the 2nd using a Groupon! It was important to me to collect all of our favorite photos and put them in a tangible flip-through book. Travel is important to us, and surrounding ourselves with photos of trips we’ve taken helps us make the adventure last longer! It also puts the value of travel in front of us, inspiring us to save toward more trips.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Notable Mentions&nbsp;</h2>



<p>I didn’t set out for these goals, but honestly they’re things I am so out-of-this-world proud of.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Losing 20lbs&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Mid October</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="866" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0295.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2820"/><figcaption>Optavia</figcaption></figure>



<p>I began trying to lose weight before Disney but never made it very far. I am addicted to sugar and struggle with overeating. I began Optavia and fell in LOVE with the program. After 3 months I am down 20lbs and am so very happy with my body. For the first time I am happy to say I lost weight in the past year!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Writing Professionally Again&nbsp;</h2>



<p>November&nbsp;</p>



<p>I didn’t set out to make money writing again. In fact, I don’t feel like I have much time! This post has taken a few different attempts. A friend needed someone to write a few articles for a local online news source. It was super cool and exciting. I have NEVER written for a news source. It was scary not knowing the ropes…but kinda cool too. I learned to write in a different style, interview contacts, and meet guidelines. I learned about local happenings and enjoyed a little bit of extra money.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Hosting a Girls Brunch&nbsp;</h2>



<p>December&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s always a reason to avoid having people over. For me, it’s been Bella. I decided to host a girls Christmas brunch. It was so much fun. My dad and his wife watched Bella and I had about 8-10 friends over for yummy food, drinks, crafts, and Christmas movies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I learned so much about this tradition. I embraced long days inside and warm, cozy, blankets. Hygge is the Danish/Norwegian word for a mood of coziness. I listened to&nbsp; “The Little Book of Hygge” while feeding Bella via pump for hours. I decorated with the things I had around the house or Goodwill candles. I rested. It was perfect for the stage of life we were in (in isolation) and is something I want to continue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there you have it. My 2019. I’d like to do separate posts about Bella’s milestones and my milestones for 2020. I wonder if I’ll find the time?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Love + Light, </p>

<p>You see, Bella was born a micropreemie. She weighed ONE pound and SEVEN ounces. That&#8217;s it. At first, you couldn&#8217;t notice the Hemangioma at all on her scalp, but as she grew, it grew too. I&#8217;ve written a long post about Hemangiomas and <a href="https://poeticlaughter.com/whats-on-her-head-a-hemangioma-story/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">what they are here</a>, but the short and sweet answer is this: </p>



<p>&#8220;A hemangioma (he-man-jee-O-muh) is a bright red birthmark that shows up at birth or in the first or second week of life. It looks like a rubbery bump and is made up of extra blood vessels in the skin.&#8221; Mayo Clinic </p>



<p>Bella had 6 at one point. They were all almost unnoticeable except the one on her scalp which grew aggressively once she was adjusted to a newborn. We eventually made the decision to treat it because it was threatening to break open and could get infected. Personally, I was a little relieved we treated it from a cosmetic standpoint, too. I was concerned she wouldn&#8217;t have hair growth where the Hemangioma was and I was also concerned about the long-term effects of the loose skin once it went back down in size. </p>



<p>The other 5 weren&#8217;t a problem and they were itty bitty red dots. There were 2 on her chest, 1 near her navel and 1 behind her ear. Since she had so many, the Pediatric Dermatologist ordered an ultrasound to rule out any internal ones. It was a frustrating process because something was detected on her liver&#8230;but 6 months later it was ruled as a misread and perhaps just a shadow. Those times of waiting were very stressful. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="3264" height="2448" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_8828.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2772" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/img_8828-3/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2772"/><figcaption>The small black spots were where it began to break down. </figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="3264" height="2448" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_8829.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2770" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/img_8829-2/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2770"/><figcaption>We took lots of pictures for the Dr. and to keep track of the progress. </figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>4 months ago we began to wean her off her medication. This was exciting, but scary! We had to do it very slowly since it was a medication that affected her blood pressure. Once she was off the medication, Propranolol, we waited. Although very rare, Hemangiomas can have some regrowth. Unfortunately Bella&#8217;s did. We called and re-started the medication for 6 weeks. We weaned again. Tediously, we prayed that the Hemangioma would stay down while we weaned slowly off the medication. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="2395" height="3600" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Montgomery36.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2778"/><figcaption>In the Spring, we took pictures for Mother&#8217;s Day! We were still on medication <br><br></figcaption></figure>



<p>Today, she&#8217;s been off the medicine for over 2 months! Sometimes it looks puffier, since she still has some blood vessels outside where the Hemangioma is, but mostly it has stayed down and almost flush with her scalp. </p>

<p>We are so thankful for Dr. Nguyen and his team at Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital. They walked us through each step and monitored Bella very closely when we began the medication. He answered all of our questions and was available any time we needed him! He even would message me back quickly and called us on his cellphone when the Hemangioma looked very bad. </p>



<p>We are so thankful it has gone down and isn&#8217;t a risk to her health! A few friends have said they love it, because it&#8217;s uniquely HER! I agree!  </p>

<p>I wanted to write this post to encourage anyone whose baby was born with Hemangiomas. I&#8217;m not an expert, but have been through it. I&#8217;m always happy to answer any questions! </p>



<p>Love and Light, </p>

<p>As soon as I found out I was expecting a baby I began pinning all different ideas to Pinterest. Regardless of the gender, I knew I</p>



<p>1.) Wanted the nursery to have a lot of white and neutrals in it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2.) Wanted to simplify the space and make it a relaxing oasis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3.) Wanted my amazing sister, Kayley, to sew a custom quilt for my little one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had pinned ideas for both boys and girls. Later, once we found out we were expecting a sweet little girl, I zeroed in on different ideas. After a lot of thought and planning, Dustin and I decided to go with a simple, traditional nursery with gold, pink, and florals.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="660" height="880" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8897.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2594" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8897.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8897-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8897-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<p>Ideas that we decided against included: bohemian, Kate Spade, wooden &#8220;adventure&#8221;, and damask.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="660" height="880" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8896.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2593" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8896.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8896-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8896-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<p>I don&#8217;t like a lot of clutter. I have anxiety and things thrown about can trigger stress for me. I like whites, clean lines, and lots of storage! I wanted the space to look like a baby&#8217;s room, but I also wanted the dresser and other large ticket items to grow with Isabella. I think that it&#8217;s important for kids to decorate their own space, but I know for now, the space is more for mommy and daddy, and not so much Bella, so we did what we would enjoy best.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It ended up amazing. The space is EXACTLY what I dreamed of. I think it has a lot of character and is classic, yet fun for a baby girl. In these picture we haven&#8217;t hung all the artwork on the walls yet, or accents (like above the crib), but you can see where it&#8217;s headed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will also be using this space in the future as we do foster/adopt. The space is Bella&#8217;s, but can also house another little one. With this thought in mind, we kept things like the crib neutral, in case Bella outgrows it and we are placed with a boy.</p>

<p>Above are the images that I pinned that really inspired me. I loved the idea of mixing florals with white and grays. Of course you always need a lil bling, so I worked in strategic gold accents.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Beginning Stages</h2>

<p>The process was&#8230;.a process! We used the room to store a lot of mix/match things until we had the time to get organized and make it ours. </p>

<p>We were so blessed by my sister, family, and friends with a lot of generous items for Bella. I ended up being hospitalized only 2 days after my shower, so we had to come back and re-organize it later. </p>

<p>Above, you can see we certainly organized and decorated in stages. Have your little one in the NICU for over 100 days makes it hard to finish a nursery. So many people helped us. We had such great support. <br></p>



<h2>It&#8217;s Finished. (Mostly) </h2>



<p>Today, almost 11 months after our emergency c-section and delivery 3 months early&#8230;the nursery is mostly DONE! Since Isabella has a gtube and other health concerns, she sleeps in our room, BUT, this space is heavenly. I walk in and touch everything. It smells so fresh and clean and baby-ish. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had this post in &#8220;draft&#8221; for so long! Today the room looks so different, but I wanted to post it anyway since it is so fun! </p>

<p>Honestly, it&#8217;s hard to imagine it&#8217;s taken so long to get these thoughts out of my head&#8230;but when you have a little one that has a lot of needs&#8230;heck&#8230;if you just have a little one&#8230;you get it. I&#8217;ve begun writing a post about Isabella&#8217;s &#8220;other 2 NICU moms&#8221; a thousand times but every time it just doesn&#8217;t seem to do them justice. So, with nurses week and Mother&#8217;s Day upon us and the fact that Bella is successfully napping in her crib, I thought I&#8217;d take a stab at it once more. </p>



<h2>How Do You Thank Someone Who Literally Sustains/Loves/Cares for Your Baby As Their Own?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="768" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7125.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2725"/><figcaption>She loves them..even though her face looks smug! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Candy, cards, mugs&#8230;these small gifts seem so humble compared to the immeasurable love and support Nicole and Jackie have given our family. Writing a quick Facebook post for Nurses Week also pales in comparison. You see, these two women, one my age, and one younger, literally acted as mothers to Bella while staying in the NICU for 3 1/2 months. Jackie and Nicole are among the brightest, most professional, kindest, calmest, amazing women/nurses/people you will ever meet. </p>



<h2>Jackie Taught Us Details</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="576" height="768" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7003.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2738"/><figcaption>Jackie helping us with Bella before discharge. </figcaption></figure>



<p>At only two days old, Jackie signed up to &#8220;primary&#8221; us. This means she choose to care for Isabella and our family when she was on her shift at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Before I even could hold my baby she was able to change her diapers, apply Aquaphor to her translucent skin, talk to her, and love her as an excellent nurse would. </p>



<p>You see, in many cases with preemies, the mom is unable to go with the baby to the NICU. In our case I had to stay behind at another hospital for 3 days and be monitored because of my health. While away, I missed out on precious moments with Bella and lived through snapshots on Dustin&#8217;s phone and stories from my family who were there to see her. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="819" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-205-1024x819.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2258" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-205-1024x819.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-205-300x240.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-205-768x614.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-205-640x512.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-205.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Bella, 14 days old. </figcaption></figure>



<h4>All the while I was pumping/trying to pee without crying/learning to hobble around my room/etc. a woman that was a stranger had chosen to love our family and along with others was providing the best care I could possibly imagine for my 1 pound 7 ounce little girl. </h4>



<p>I didn&#8217;t even know her name. But a week after the delivery and the day (or 2 it blurs together) after we moved into Isabella&#8217;s private NICU room I found out she would be consistently caring for our sweet girl. </p>



<p>She has chosen us and I was honored that a nurse of her expertise in small babies would dedicate so much of her knowledge and energy to my newborn. But, honestly, I assumed she would give so much to little Bella. What I didn&#8217;t realize as how much she would give to ME.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="888" height="666" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7006.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2740"/><figcaption>Jackie encouraging Bella to pass her carseat test</figcaption></figure>



<p>Jackie is someone that pushes herself in everything she does. She is knowledgable, quick witted, kind, and to-the-point. Along with being a registered nurse, she strives to achieve other certifications, including Kangaroo Care! As I spent days learning to care for an extremely fragile infant, I got to know Jackie and learned a little bit about her and what made her passionate for the NICU. Her little brother had had cancer and although he had overcome it, the impact had weighed heavily on her. She strived to make an impact in other&#8217;s lives and ended up getting a position with the top NICU (where we were) and within the same hospital her little brother had been cared for years earlier. I loved her. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="576" height="768" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_8981-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2728"/><figcaption>Jackie holding Bella post-NICU </figcaption></figure>



<p>I loved talking with her and it was so refreshing to learn the best &#8220;do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts&#8221; within the NICU walls. The little room on the 7th floor holding that itty bitty baby became a sanctuary for me. As I asked questions, I began building my confidence as a mom. I learned what each number on the monitor meant and even how to attach the leads for Bella if they fell off (with the approval of the nurses). I memorized her schedule and even helped take her temperature or lower/raise her isolette.  Of course Jackie was a busy lady. She didn&#8217;t have a second to grab a bite to eat most shifts, (let alone play cards <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) and I would watch in shock as she ran back and forth between patient rooms and answered to patient calls. She was kind, yet confident and knew what needed to be done to achieve the best health for those babies. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="506" height="675" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_5416.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2742"/><figcaption>Jackie, teaching me to give Bella a &#8220;bath&#8221; </figcaption></figure>



<h4>Although we became friends, I always knew that her job as a nurse came first and she was so prompt and exact. I constantly was impressed by her professionalism and love for those babies. </h4>



<p>I remember vividly Jackie helping me with Bella&#8217;s feed through her OG (feeding tube through her mouth). We were discussing something and one of the rooms began to code. Minutes earlier the team making rounds had been in our room, going over Bella&#8217;s care, laughing at my jokes, and talking about local things to do. My heart always panicked when I&#8217;d hear our neighbors in trouble and I&#8217;d always sigh a sigh of relief it wasn&#8217;t Bella, but then push back tears for the other moms. Jackie stopped mid sentence and was laser focused. She ran (along with the other team members who had traveled to the next room) to the room where the alarm was going off. I could tell each and every team member was ready to save a life. Thankfully, this was a misunderstanding and a new parent or grandparent pushed the wrong call button. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="576" height="768" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_8986.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2724"/><figcaption>Jackie (pregnant) &amp; I post NICU </figcaption></figure>



<h4>Seeing this made me so confident that if something happened to our Bella, a nurse, just like Jackie, would come to her aid and put her safety as the top priority. </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="506" height="675" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_5661.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2743"/><figcaption>Practicing Kangaroo Care </figcaption></figure>



<p>For Jackie, her job is more than a job. When there were little ones whose families weren&#8217;t present she would spend extra time, making sure the baby was comforted. In those early days she advised me on how to do &#8220;skin to skin&#8221; and to bond with Isabella. As the weeks went on, she challenged me to be the very best mom I could be and reminded me that I was Isabella&#8217;s MOM, even though I had to have assistance to even get her out of her rainforst-like isolette. I couldn&#8217;t even touch her in ways that would cause her to be overstimulated. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="900" height="675" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_5678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2745"/><figcaption>Bella wrapped in a fun bandana with cute sheets via Jackie </figcaption></figure>



<p>It was a hard place to be, but the encouragement from Jackie and the other nurses helped me to learn about my baby and her specific needs. For the first time I learned what the word &#8220;advocate&#8221; truly meant and I threw myself into reading all about the NICU and my daughters condition. Along the way I&#8217;d ask Jackie questions as she helped me change diapers, weigh poos/pees, get Bella&#8217;s temperature, or give her baths.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="819" height="1024" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-178-819x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2203" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-178-819x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 819w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-178-240x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 240w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-178-768x961.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-178-640x801.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-178.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></figure>



<p>Jackie was the one who encouraged me to help give Bella her first &#8220;bath,&#8221; helped me hold her to my breast for stimulation, taught me all about the ABC&#8217;s of safe sleep, and reassured me that Bella was going to be great! Throughout the day/night/etc. Jackie was there in the background, cheering us on, teaching, and doing what she did best, caring for her patient, who happened to be less than 2 pounds. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="506" height="675" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_5591.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2744"/><figcaption>Jackie found a &#8220;dress&#8221; for Bella and matching sheets </figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the most thoughtful things Jackie did for Bella was make sure she got &#8220;cute&#8221; sheets for her isolette. The NICU uses pillow cases for the bedding and some are not as cute and fun as others. Jackie would always grab fun sheets that would make us smile. They helped brighten our day when things seemed dark and overwhelming. Jackie also purchased some cute Easter decor for our room and went out of her way to spoil us! Bella got many special gifts from her &#8220;primary&#8221; and we made sure to tell her all about Jackie and Nicole. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="867" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2215.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2604" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2215.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2215-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2215-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption>Practicing Safe Sleep! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course it was with great excitement and joy that I learned Jackie was expecting a baby while caring for ours in the NICU! I was proudly one of the earlier ones to know since she battled morning sickness and she wanted us to know she wasn&#8217;t ill! As time went on, I was moved when I&#8217;d see her holding Bella and know her little one would be here eventually. Funny enough, her son was the first &#8220;baby friend&#8221; Bella had! Months later, after we were discharged, we made frequent trips back to the hospital and visited with Jackie. She was a beautiful mom from the beginning to delivery and I was so impressed by her ability to continue to excel at her job. Jackie ended up having her son early and spent 18 days in the NICU herself. Her son is thriving and they are both doing great! I got to meet and hold him. The picture we have of us 4 is extremely special to me. </p>

<h2>Nicole Taught Us Fun </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="888" height="666" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_6592.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2733"/><figcaption>Giving Isabella a Bottle While I Learn! </figcaption></figure>



<p>When Bella was a month old we were transferred to a &#8220;step down&#8221; unit. It was still for babies needing extra care, but it wasn&#8217;t the less intense &#8220;feeder/grower&#8221; floor. I remember our items were moved while we were out to dinner. It was so strange to come back to a new room, but we were so excited to be in a new space AND we were more than accommodating for a baby more critical than Bella to use the coveted room feet away from the control room where all the specialists sat. </p>

<p>This new floor gave way for a new special friendship with Nicole. Jackie and Nicole, as I learned later, had primaried a baby before, taking turns to care for him on a regular basis. As a primary, a nurse gets to know a child that will be in a hospital setting for a long time. This is great for the child and parents because they have consistent care and an advocate who KNOWS the child in and out. If a child doesn&#8217;t have a family, a nurse can request to primary it. Jackie and Nicole had cared for a few babies who didn&#8217;t have families. They&#8217;d spend their own money for special clothing, Christmas gifts, or toys. They were the &#8220;moms&#8221; to these babies, who knew no one else! </p>

<h4> In a lot of ways, Jackie and Nicole knew more about Bella than I did. At first that bothered me, but then later I was so relieved because I had not one, but TWO dynamite professionals cheering on my daughter and my family. This also meant I could learn about her care and help when needed. </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="576" height="768" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_6234.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2731"/><figcaption>A Onesie I Made For Bella to Wear </figcaption></figure>



<p>So, back to Nicole. Nicole is one of the chillest people you&#8217;ll ever meet. She&#8217;s laid back enough to feel relaxed around, but able to get the job (or in her case 1,000 jobs) done! She doesn&#8217;t drink coffee, which I found/find appalling, (haha) but is able to do all-nighters like nobody&#8217;s business. The first time I met Nicole I immediately had a girl crush. She was fun, outgoing, silly, attentive, and told me that the hospital cafeteria had these delicious &#8220;hollywood peanut butter chocolate squares&#8221; on Wednesdays. Her bright colors and love for owls drew me in. I wanted to have her care for Bella every day and smiled whenever I saw she&#8217;d be in. Soon enough, she actually signed up to primary us with Jackie. I was thrilled. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="576" height="768" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7049.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2734"/><figcaption>NICU Grad (Later was readmitted) </figcaption></figure>



<p>I told her it reminded me of dating. &#8220;I like her? Does she like us? Would she like to care for our family? What if she doesn&#8217;t like us or think that&#8217;s weird?&#8221; The love ended up being mutual and even after getting pooped on a lot, she still stuck it out with us. </p>



<p>With Nicole, we had her a lot during during late nights and before Bella was discharged. As she taught us to feed Bella, we had more time to talk and get to know one another. As the babies in the NICU become stronger, they need less and less attention from the nurses. Bella&#8217;s care went from 1:1, to 2:1, to 3:1, and even sometimes 4:1 if there was a gap in nursing shifts. This was a good thing that Bella needed less and less care, but it was harder and more isolating because you didn&#8217;t get to see a nurse as much. You learned to do a lot more as a parent, which is exactly what we wanted to do! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="576" height="768" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7051.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2727"/><figcaption>Owl Bottom </figcaption></figure>



<p>Nicole taught us to have fun. Although she was extremely thorough in Bella&#8217;s care (and ours), she always took a minute to laugh or give an extra snuggle. We adopted a lot of Nicole&#8217;s nicknames for Bella and use them to this day, like &#8220;Little Miss&#8221; and Dustin&#8217;s favorite from another NICU mom &#8220;Stinkerella.&#8221; Nicole and I connected on a personal level and I constantly had to keep myself from talking her ear off so she could do her job! She helped us learn about Bella&#8217;s unique personality. </p>



<p>It felt taboo sometimes to attribute characteristics or just play with Bella in the NICU. The first time I saw anyone ever just play with Bella was Nicole. She had her on her pulled up knees and was lightly touching her nose. She loved it! I sat shocked. Of course our baby could play, but I hadn&#8217;t really considered holding her normally, even though she was old enough. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="576" height="768" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_6848.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2737"/><figcaption>Happy with Nicole! </figcaption></figure>



<h4>I felt like everything we did had to have a specific &#8220;cause&#8221; or &#8220;medical outcome.&#8221; To just play and relax with our little blessing was surprisingly new to me. </h4>



<p>After watching Nicole, I learned how to &#8220;play&#8221; with Bella. I had always read to her, but for the first time I made extra silly faces and tried peek-a-boo. In some ways I think I just assumed Bella wouldn&#8217;t advance from that newborn/preemie/isolette stage. I hadn&#8217;t spent a lot of time considering her out of her isolette or in a home setting. Nicole helped me learn to imagine&#8230;FREEDOM. She spoke about the future and treated Bella as if she was a normal baby.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="576" height="768" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_5871.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2722"/><figcaption>Helping Dad Give Bella Her First &#8220;Tub&#8221; Bath </figcaption></figure>



<p>Nicole also shared a love for food. She liked sweets (like me) and we loved bringing donuts and Insomniac cookies when we could. I remember learning that she was the culprit for many of the babies signs on their doors. Each door had a fun sign with the babies name and other information. This made the NICU more fun! When I&#8217;d walk the halls late at night I&#8217;d read all the signs. It helped humanize these tiny babies. Seeing their names written in fun colors with markers was up lifting. </p>



<h4>It turns out Nicole had her own set of markers/supplies and would make signs for the babies without families. </h4>



<p>When I learned that there were many abandoned babies or babies without visitors I became very sad. Knowing that nurses like Nicole loved on those babies made me smile. Bella, of course, got lots of signs made from yours truly. Quotes, pictures, coloring sheets, etc. were plastered all over the door. It made me feel happy to bring beauty into her little space. Looking back, I spent a lot of time perfecting the decor in her private room. It was one of the few things I had control over and it brought me a lot of joy. I took a lot of pictures to remember those days. Thankfully, Nicole let me use her markers! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="576" height="768" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7043.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2721"/><figcaption>I loved seeing Nicole was our Nurse! </figcaption></figure>



<p>As the days went on and on and on, we began to think of Nicole as family. She&#8217;d watch Bella when we&#8217;d be out and near the end we began staying at the Ronald McDonald house and not in her room. Nicole and Jackie would leave us notes and I knew she was in good hands as they helped teach her to take bottles. Nicole rearranged her schedule just to be at Bella&#8217;s discharge. She helped us get her tiny little body in her carseat and celebrated every step out of the hospital walls. She shed tears with us and spoiled Bella with clothes and toys throughout her stay. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="576" height="768" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9563-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2739"/><figcaption>Cuddling with Bella OUTSIDE of the NICU! </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Continued Love, Fun Aunts</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="576" height="768" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1829-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2723"/><figcaption>Bella hanging with Nicole on Halloween! Post NICU </figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking back, what I didn&#8217;t know was that I would rely heavily on the strength and love Nicole and Jackie gave in the NICU. When you&#8217;re discharged you assume things will go smoothly. The worst is over. Unfortunately for us, a lot of trouble hit when we were discharged. Bella was readmitted within 3 days for an aspiration event and ended up needing a gastronomy tube. Later, she developed some severe health issues. </p>



<h4>With the love of these nurses and knowledge, I was able to advocate well for my daughter outside of the hospital walls and get her the care she deserved/deserves. </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="576" height="768" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4856.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2709"/><figcaption>Nicole, Me, and an ever-growing Bella! Lunch Post NICU </figcaption></figure>



<p>She is still unable to eat at 14 months, has undergone many tests, is on 3 different prescriptions, and has gained way too many diagnosis, but I learned the &#8220;ropes&#8221; in the NICU and recall what Nicole and Jackie taught me on a daily basis. </p>



<h4>Today, I don&#8217;t look as Jackie and Nicole as &#8220;Moms&#8221; to Bella anymore. </h4>



<p>I&#8217;ve taken over all of her care and wouldn&#8217;t want it any other way&#8230;but they still hold a very special place in our family and hearts. I like to think of them both as Aunts! We stay in touch with each and have now added them on social media at my request. They always &#8220;like&#8221; Bella&#8217;s pictures, write comments, and check-in on us. If I have questions I can ask them and they are always there as friends. Both have prayed for us and have become such great friends. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="506" height="675" src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1679-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2746"/><figcaption>Easter 2019, A Year Later! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course it was a huge blessing when Nicole came to Bella&#8217;s first birthday party. She drove over 2hrs and celebrated with us! Jackie was busy being a momma to her little one but we saw her shortly after. Both nurses are still actively working in the NICU and loving others well. </p>



<p>When we met Nicole for lunch a few months ago I found myself feeling&#8230;jealous! I was jealous that she&#8217;d probably &#8220;moved on and had another primary family in the NICU&#8221;&#8230;it was such a funny feeling. I then reminded myself that it was AWESOME that she had more love to give and that we were good and in a different season. </p>



<p>Although I found slight jealousy that another family may be receiving this amazing love/care/professionalism from our nurses, I was overjoyed that they&#8217;re changing lives every day. </p>



<h4>And for me? I&#8217;ll just keep remembering them every Mother&#8217;s Day and trying to express my eternal gratitude for the time when they were both mother&#8217;s to my Isabella. </h4>

<p>Last week we had our well check up for Isabella. Our doctor, Dr. Burns with Akron Children&#8217;s Pediatrics shook his head and said, &#8220;She&#8217;s a miracle.&#8221; </p>

Modeling with a big bow and diaper. </figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s true. She is a miracle. She has come so stinking far. She amazes us every day. On the 1st she&#8217;ll be 11 months old. So very close to ONE YEAR.</p>



<p>We are very proud of her. Her strength and joy is contagious. </p>



<p>One of my favorite things to do is reflect on God&#8217;s mercy and grace. He has tossed buckets on us over the last year. </p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have a lot of time to write a full update, but I will say this:</p>



<p>Isabella is thriving. She is growing and is over 14 lbs. She is patient and always quick with a smile. She loves family and cuddles. She doesn&#8217;t love wearing hats and jumps at overly loud noises. Her grin and two little teeth make everyone smile. </p>



<p>Here are some pictures that we&#8217;ve collected this month&#8230;but first, a few of where she&#8217;s come from. </p>



<p>Below was the first time I touched her. She was a day old. Less than 1lb 7 ounces. </p>

<p>Below she was 9 days old. This was Dustin&#8217;s 31st birthday. I made the cute little sign for her to hold. </p>

<p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so excited that I was able to have time to be creative over the last month or so. Thanks to my amazing husband and family, I&#8217;ve had a little bit of free time here and there to de-stress and enjoy crafting. I&#8217;ve always loved making things with my hands and baking. With Bella, I haven&#8217;t had a lot of time, energy, or funds to do it! For Christmas I received some awesome craft items from generous family members and I discovered felt quiet books as well!</p>
<h1>Jaxson&#8217;s Quiet Book</h1>
<p><figure id="attachment_2633" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2633" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3025.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2633" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3025.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="650" height="867" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3025.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3025-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3025-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2633" class="wp-caption-text">Jaxson&#8217;s finished quiet book</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I learned about Quiet Books and became obsessed with them. I started by teaching myself and cutting everything out and sewing it by hand. In the end I learned how to do a blanket stitch, install grommets (metal rings) and follow free patterns. The other things I knew how to do before.</p>

<p>I used templates from the blog <a href="https://www.imagineourlife.com/2012/01/03/dump-truck-quiet-book-page/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Imagine Our Life</a> (thank you!) as well as some I found online and others I freehanded.</p>

<p>In the end, I made the following pages:</p>
<p>Cover Page, Tractor, wheels spin</p>
<p>Pizza Page, Pizza slices with pepperoni can be counted and can Velcro onto right spaces</p>
<p>Ice Cream Page, Stack a fun colorful ice cream cone</p>
<p>Farm Pages, Finger puppets with open/close barn doors, Page for puppets to &#8220;play&#8221;</p>
<p>Dump Truck Page, Dump Truck &#8220;empties&#8221; and you can take rock in/out of truck bed</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2632" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2632" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3020.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2632" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3020.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="650" height="867" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3020.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3020-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3020-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2632" class="wp-caption-text">Bella approves</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I bound the pages with grommets and binder rings. This way. I can add/subtract to the book. I choose to finish off each page individually so that we could interchange them easier. Believe it or not, I never took pictures of the finished book! I gifted it to Jaxson and forgot to do a video of the book pages. I will have to do that. A lot of these pictures aren&#8217;t or it finished but in different stages. I loved it. It took a lot of time though, and planning!</p>
<h1>Baby Christmas Felt Books</h1>

<p>Then, I decided to make Christmas themed baby felt books. I made a total of 4. They also took more time than I planned! Almost all of these I freehanded but the fox. <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/141706040/Fox-Softie-Pattern#fullscreen?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">I found the pattern here. </a></p>

<p>I really loved how these turned out. I stuck to easy silhouettes and only used embroidery thread and felt. I struggled with binding them, since I didn&#8217;t want to use the grommets or things that could be a choking hazard. I ended up threading them together and tying a knot. For two of them I attached them to little baby links. Of course for Isabella&#8217;s I had to &#8220;sign&#8221; it on the back. Each had 4 pages. They are pretty small. Jaxsons was bigger, but these were meant to be handled by little fingers!</p>

<p>We have an old German family recipe for lard sugar cookies. Yes, lard! It&#8217;s crazy but really addictive. I&#8217;ve been making and eating them since I was a little girl. We made them with my dad (as always) and I was creative and decorated the ones below.</p>

<h1>Fleece Blankets</h1>
<p>Money has been a bit tight this year! We cut our budget back by quite a bit. Instead of buying everyone on our list individual gifts, we made everyone a fleece blanket! This was fun because</p>
<p>1.) it was pretty cost effective (no blanket was more than $17 each) <a href="https://www.joann.com/search?q=fleece+kit&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">We bought the kits from Joanns when they were 40% off. </a></p>
<p>2.) it gave me something to work on and craft</p>
<p>3.) each was picked out based on the person&#8217;s likes</p>

<p>Everyone liked theirs. They wash up really well (I&#8217;ve washed mine A LOT with Bella vomiting) and I did a different tie which made the prints switch sides. It was more of a &#8220;in/out&#8221; fold instead of a tie. It helped the blankets to lay nicely. I&#8217;m not sure what it&#8217;s called. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3UgR6rKEoE&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">I used this video and cut the notches. </a></p>
<p>This project took longer than I thought as well. Haha. I was rushing around trying to finish them in time. I folded and tied them with yarn.</p>

<p>I saw this idea on Pinterest and had to try it. I wasn&#8217;t crazy about it, but was bored and wanted to make a Grandparent gifts from the baby. I made a big mistake by getting her toe nails dyed green after applying water color paints! haha The cards weren&#8217;t perfect, but it was a free craft (I had all supplies at home) and I had fun making memories with Bella.</p>
<p>You can see I&#8217;ve been pretty busy crafting! This has helped a lot with stress. It&#8217;s been very fun to work with my hands and make beautiful things.</p>
<p>Hope you had a blessed Christmas,</p>
<p>T</p>
