					<description><![CDATA[This is such a sweet idea! I also love sending little &quot;presents&quot; through the mail. Although, I&#039;ve never thought of using these types of fun and inexpensive items. I agree about getting outside of ourselves. It really helps to improve my mood when I do that. Thanks for the cool inspiration!]]></description>

Thanks so much Danielle! When I first begun writing letters and sending packages it felt like a lot of work...but now that I have all the supplies it&#039;s pretty quick and easy. It&#039;s also nice for those who don&#039;t use Facedbook, like my 90 year old great grandma. haha]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the extra thought put into a handwritten card as opposed to a quick FB message or text.  It just makes people feel so good to know someone took the time.  I definitely will need to try the sunshine box in the future.  I love it! Great job!]]></description>
