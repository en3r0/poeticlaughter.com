<p>The past few weeks have been extremely exciting here!</p>
<p>Isabella got to meet both her Godmother, Sarah, and NICU Bestie For Life, Evelyn (which deserves it&#8217;s own post)! I wanted to share some special pictures and moments. We cherish each and every time we can share Bella in person with others.</p>

<p>Sarah has been in my life since I got married in 2010. Dustin, my husband actually introduced us and she sang and played guitar at our wedding! (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRehmX3zlwE&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Click here to hear the song she played, Your Guardian Angel by Red Jumpsuit Apparatus</a>) Since then we&#8217;ve become best friends. We&#8217;ve bonded over many cups of coffee and random Youtube videos.</p>

<p>Sarah&#8217;s one of the strongest women I know. She loves Jesus and lives to serve others.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s also a very talented musician (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/sarah_goff?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">check her out here</a>).</p>

<p>Before Isabella was born, I asked my two besties, Sarah and Jessica, to be Godmothers to Isabella. For me, that meant that they would support Isabella in her faith journey and always be there for her. To us, it was kind of like asking them to be an auntie.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2370" style="width: 506px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9168-e1539042265370.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class=" wp-image-2370" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9168-e1539042265370-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="506" height="674" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9168-e1539042265370-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9168-e1539042265370-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9168-e1539042265370-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9168-e1539042265370.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 960w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Celebrating Jess at her Bridal Shower</figcaption></figure>
<p>Since before Bella was here these ladies have loved her and prayed for her. Jessica&#8217;s been busy planning a wedding and being a newlywed but has always prayed for Bella and cared for me. Sarah has gone out of her way on so many occasions to bless us with Starbucks, words of encouragement, gifts, and hugs.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2371" style="width: 539px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class=" wp-image-2371" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="539" height="404" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Sarah meeting Bella through our glass door</figcaption></figure>
<p>Above: Before meeting Bella in person, Sarah got to get a glimpse of her through our glass door in the summer.</p>
<p>So it was super exciting after 7 months that Sarah was able to visit and hold her Goddaughter! Bella loved every second and fell asleep! She immediately felt the love that Sarah had for her. God had hand picked both Jess and Sarah to play a special role in Bella&#8217;s life. I&#8217;m so thankful for the prayers and support they&#8217;ve offered&#8230;even without ever setting eyes on Bella in person.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Saturday and Dustin is feeding Bella. I snuck away to write a few quick words on here!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so so happy to share these amazing family photographs with you. As I mentioned in my <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/27-weeker-micropreemie-photoshoot/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">blog post before</a>, having photos done in the NICU was amazing and special&#8230;but I dreamed of family photos outside of the hospital walls! Oh&#8230;and having Bella unhooked from all the wires!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll note that in these pictures she&#8217;s about 6 months old. The ones from the NICU were taken when she was 14 days old.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2300" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-1024x681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-300x200.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-768x511.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery38-640x426.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Teresa Young of Teresa Young Photography made this dream a reality and came to our home to take photographs of us in our backyard. She was so incredibly flexible. In fact, the day we had scheduled for her to take our photos, <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/im-getting-tired-of-the-er-when-bellas-gtube-falls-out-pt1/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Bella&#8217;s feeding tube fell out</a> and we had to head to Akron, an hour and a half away. We had to cancel!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2316" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-681x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="681" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-681x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 681w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-200x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 200w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-768x1154.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery12-1-640x962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /></a></p>
<p>So we rescheduled. She came over and was so kind and amazing. She even went for hand sanitizer before I awkwardly needed to ask! (Loving acts that speak to a preemie momma&#8217;s soul!) It was so nice to have her meet Bella, since I don&#8217;t get to share her with many people. We waited until the last minute to put our coordinated outfits on for fear of Bella vomiting on all of them. This was a great decision since she did in fact throw up all over herself and Dustin right before Teresa walked in the door!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery19.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2323" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery19-682x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="682" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery19-682x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 682w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery19-200x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 200w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery19-768x1154.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery19-640x962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a></p>
<p>I stressed so much about everything looking &#8220;perfect.&#8221; In the end I was just thankful that we were alive. And here. And able to take photos. I even considered paying someone to paint our fence (it only got one coat last season)&#8230;but that was silly and Teresa assured me she could make the photos look nice in our less-than-perfect backyard. She was right!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2320" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-682x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="682" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-682x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 682w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-200x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 200w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-768x1154.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Montgomery16-640x962.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a></p>
<p>Bella was nervous. She really hasn&#8217;t been outside much and it was her very first time on a blanket in the grass! It was very humid and I was sweating buckets. My makeup was sweating off! BUT&#8230;Teresa did such a great job that when I see these&#8230;my eyes don&#8217;t immediately go to the imperfections&#8230;but to the joy we all have. Even though Bella wouldn&#8217;t give us a smile&#8230;she looks healthy and relaxed. She also looks very inquisitive.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be honest&#8230;my thoughts did go to her birthmark. (The large red bump on her scalp) I can be a little insecure about it still from time to time. <a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/whats-on-her-head-a-hemangioma-story/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">We&#8217;re treating it because it was harming her,</a> but we probably would treat it regardless at this point for cosmetic reasons. I&#8217;m all for loving yourself as God made you&#8230;but this in particular can give her issues down the road and is a quick and mild fix. That all being said, I love it because it&#8217;s a part of her and what makes her, her. I&#8217;ve grown to accept it as who God&#8217;s made her&#8230;but know that if there&#8217;s a solution that will improve her quality of life&#8230;I&#8217;m going to take it. Especially if it&#8217;s not harming her. My eye does go to the red bump&#8230;as I&#8217;m sure other&#8217;s do, but I&#8217;m not sad about it anymore.</p>
<p>As my Grandma said &#8220;If that&#8217;s the only thing she&#8217;s taking out of the NICU with her&#8230;we can rejoice&#8221; Or as Dustin says lovingly &#8220;She&#8217;s so beautiful&#8230;maybe God put it there to keep her humble.&#8221; haha</p>

<p>These photos are what I dreamed of. They&#8217;re as &#8220;Pinterest Perfect&#8221; as they come&#8230;but not because they were from a perfect situation. They&#8217;re perfect because they represent a warrior in this little one. A dedicated village. A sense of determination and grit and heart. The represent the heart of our God. That he loves us and wants us to grow in Him.</p>

<p>So excuse me while I go cry in a corner with a handful of Hershey Kisses while reflecting on the simplicity and beauty that Teresa captured.  Here&#8217;s a post on Facebook that I made as soon as I saw the photographs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before Bella was born&#8230;before I was pregnant with her&#8230;before our miscarriage last year&#8230;I filled Pinterest boards with newborn photography. I dreamed of our little family&#8230;perfected behind a creative lens. I virtually &#8220;shopped&#8221; for outfits and themes.</p>
<p>After we lost our first pregnancy I deleted those boards&#8230;there wouldn&#8217;t be any newborn pictures.</p>
<p>But then we found out months later we were expecting Isabella. My faith in God gave me the courage to embrace hope. Hope t<span class="text_exposed_show">hat this little soul would be in family photos. Once again I filled inspiration boards&#8230;as the months went by they became tailored to a little baby girl <span class="_5mfr _47e3"><img class="img" role="presentation" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/f3/1/16/1f380.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="16" height="16" /><span class="_7oe">?</span></span></span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>As much as we can plan, God directs our lives. I hadn&#8217;t dreamt that Bella would be born 3 months early and we would spend 110 days in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. I never imagined it&#8217;d take 60 days for my own mother to touch her&#8230;or almost 6 months for these precious precious family photographs.</p>
<p>While in the hospital a photographer took pictures of us when Bella was only 14 days old. Not yet 2lbs&#8230;these photos are now so special&#8230;even with her wires, no clothing, and cpap on. Yet&#8230;I still dreamed and hoped for pictures of our sweet girl free of hospital walls.</p>
<p>The road to these photographs is marked with loss, heart break, confusion, joy, peace, fear, and more. The truth that we are even physically here in these pictures does not fall short on us. We miss our first little one terribly, but are so thankful Bella and I are here. Tears run down my cheeks as I realize my dream of family photos has been honored by our amazing God.</p>
<p>And then, to add that the amazingly talented young women and friend who captured these has children of her own..and one who has/is facing medical challenges&#8230;blows me away. Teresa Young was so gracious and flexible. We had to cancel on her because Bella&#8217;s gtube fell out. We didn&#8217;t have our fence painted or even our own blanket to pose on&#8230;but she came to our home and captured these for us&#8230;at no charge. She used hand sanitizer without me prompting and understood how fragile Bella was and how she was one of the very first non-family members to meet her. I was sweating buckets and Bella was nervous being near grass for the first time&#8230;but it worked. These pictures are so anticipated and treasured. The power of God working through Teresa is incredible. Please, consider getting family photos done. Things don&#8217;t have to be perfect. You don&#8217;t have to be your goal weight or have everything figured out. I was terrified Bella would vomit all over. I was worried her birthmark would look weird. (She didn&#8217;t and it doesn&#8217;t). Whatever is holding you back, don&#8217;t let it. You won&#8217;t regret it. Consider Teresa Young. She&#8217;s amazing. Thank you for creating something priceless for me. And sending them at the perfect time&#8230;when there&#8217;s fear and uncertainty and nervousness in my heart for my sweet girl.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just be over here crying&#8230;and thinking up ways to display this dream realized in our home.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to curate a perfect image of your life using social media. Heck, since the beginning of time people have been wearing masks and making their lives look better than they really are. I think of the 50s housewife perfectly coiffed with dinner on the table.</p>
<p>BUT there&#8217;s a revolution happening. Freedom from having it all together. Women supporting women. Moms admitting that they&#8217;re flying by the seat of their pants. It&#8217;s empowering and&#8230;helps us feel a little less alone in this life.</p>
<p>So&#8230;let me take a moment and a pause from the super cute pictures of Bella (that I go through and delete the blurry ones) and the fun updates that include emojis. These things reflect the real me. They&#8217;re the real Bella. But they aren&#8217;t always the nitty gritty realness that&#8217;s born from confidence and courage. So let me share more into our story, Because YOU reach out to me. You tell me this inspires you.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2197" style="width: 768px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9865-e1536803931211.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-large wp-image-2197" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9865-e1536803931211-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9865-e1536803931211-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9865-e1536803931211-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9865-e1536803931211-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9865-e1536803931211.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 960w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Doing what we do best&#8230;netflix &amp; tube feed!</figcaption></figure>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I ever set out to inspire anyone by our story. To be honest I was just looking for friends&#8230;someone else who was up at 3am in a hospital room in a new, unknown city&#8230;wincing in pain from a major surgery but wanting to focus energy on a 1 1/2lb baby laying under bilirubin lights. What I know is through this sharing I&#8217;ve connected with others in a unique way and I&#8217;m so thankful for it. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So I&#8217;ll always be honest with you.</strong></span> I&#8217;ll always be positive and confident in the hope of Christ but I&#8217;ll always keep things real. So let me begin&#8230;</p>

Yes, that is projectile vomit on the floor of our bedroom. How it goes that far? I don&#8217;t know.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The last 2 days have sucked. I&#8217;ve ugly cried more than I have in weeks. I&#8217;ve said hurtful things to Dustin. I&#8217;ve been angry at myself. My head hurts and I&#8217;m exhausted. I&#8217;m also on my period which intensifies all of this and makes me feel like a sack of potatoes.</p>
<p>Numerous things have made me feel this way. We found out we have a larger minimum on a huge bill from my hospitalization that we need to move around finances to afford. Last night we realized we accidentally overrode the pictures from our NICU photo shoot (Update: They Have Been Restored!!!!!)</p>
<p>Due to frustrations and frantically trying to locate the pictures we didn&#8217;t get to sleep until 2am&#8230;so I did the 3-5 and 7-9 shift so Dustin could rest. Today I got calls from the hospital that I mailed in the wrong part of Bella&#8217;s medical device for her ph probe, I was on the phone for over 30min fixing a billing issue with our insurance, and I learned our formula is still needing paperwork done before getting mailed to us.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2198" style="width: 768px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9885-e1536804360959.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-large wp-image-2198" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9885-e1536804360959-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9885-e1536804360959-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9885-e1536804360959-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9885-e1536804360959-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Late night feeds can be fun&#8230;when we&#8217;re not exhausted!</figcaption></figure>
<p>Bella&#8217;s gtube is leaking and she&#8217;s teething. After beginning her feed this morning I tried to give her meds and the liquid sprayed all over my face and her. She ended up vomiting her whole feed down my chest and hers. I laid in dried vomit for 2hrs so she could rest on my chest with a blanket between us topless after taking my vomit soaked shirt off. My hair&#8217;s greasy and my legs are all kinds of hairy (TMI?).</p>
<p>Bella smells like spit up even though we just gave her a bath and her pump has been malfunctioning, throwing us off schedule. My floors are sticky from dripped formula from the pump/pump bags but I don&#8217;t have the time to mop them. I&#8217;m caught up on laundry but Dustin and I argued last night and said hurtful things because we were sleep deprived and sad over losing the pictures. All in all I feel like a mess.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BUT &#8230; </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gods been speaking to me in the midst of the crazy.</strong></span> He tells me I&#8217;m his and he loves Bella and I and Dustin. He says <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>loves worth fighting</strong></span> for and saying I&#8217;m sorry is hard but so worth it. Serving each other. Sharing Oreos and pouring coffee keeps us going. Smiling over Bella&#8217;s new way she grabs her toes or tries to giggle warms my heart and helps me know this is all worth it. Money will be tight but Gods got all the money in the world and I just need to be still. I try to be childlike in motherhood. I try to rely on the Spirit to guide me. I try to be playful. I try to take one moment at a time. I throw my hands up a lot. I don&#8217;t have many answers. All I know is where I end God begins and He&#8217;s caring for us.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2195" style="width: 768px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_0384-e1536804488990.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-large wp-image-2195" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_0384-e1536804488990-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_0384-e1536804488990-768x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_0384-e1536804488990-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_0384-e1536804488990-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">How is Bella cute even when she just threw up? Also, I love this shirt. Everything is better when we&#8217;re together baby doll.</figcaption></figure>
<p>So today was hard.</p>
<p>Then I got a text from a friend. We&#8217;ve been using honest company diapers. They work the best for Bella. She has sensitive skin and they&#8217;re the best fit. But they&#8217;re pricey. There&#8217;s been 3+ friends who said they have them on sale at TJ Maxx. Last time I ran out after Dustin got off work to watch Bella but size 1s were all gone. Today a friend texted me a picture and told me they were there and they&#8217;re thinking of us and love us. How thoughtful! In that moment I felt as if God had created this wonderful village around us..even though 99% haven&#8217;t met Bella in person.</p>
<h4>But then God took it to another level.</h4>
<p>This lovely person texted me there were gifts on our porch for us. I was tethered to Bella and couldn&#8217;t stop her feed/hold so I waited until Dustin came up to retrieve the items. He explained excitedly as he brought in lots of honest co diapers all in Bella&#8217;s size. There was also a Starbucks coffee for me!!! I have been trying to save money so I do cut back on Starbucks or other items&#8230;I drink coffee at home (somehow there&#8217;s always room in the budget for ice cream though lol) so this was a real treat!!! We both took turns sipping the chocolatey caffeine goodness.</p>
<p>But before then Dustin read a hand written message on the cup out loud in our living room. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I believe strongly in the power of our words.</strong></span> Our words give life. Our words are so important. To hear Dustin deliver this message over our family brought me to tears.</p>
<p>In the midst of a hard day, from the handwriting of a special friend, on a coffee cup, Dustin read over the clanking of the feeding pump</p>
<h4>&#8220;may God fill this day with wonder, joy, and assurance of his presence.&#8221;</h4>

<p>It seems like just yesterday that we left the NICU at <a href="https://www.akronchildrens.org/For-Families-Patients.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital</a>. I have very many mixed memories of that place. Some of the scariest times of my life happened behind those walls and some of the happiest.</p>
<p>In the midst of a dark time we did our best to make the NICU home. Years ago I bought an art print that says, &#8220;Home is wherever I&#8217;m with you.&#8221; (Yes, it was bought from Urban Outfitters and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHEOF_rcND8&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros</a> were popular&#8230;ok now listening to them on repeat).</p>
<p>Since our marriage, Dustin and I have moved six times. It&#8217;s funny to add &#8220;NICU&#8221; to that list. We spent most nights there but spent 17 at <a href="http://rmhakron.org/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Ronald McDonald House</a> and once a week at home to rest up. I plan on writing a lot more about making the NICU home and our experiences there. In the meantime, enjoy this video I took near the end of our stay. You can tell Bella is much more stable and is even in an open cot!</p>
<p>XOXO</p>
<p>Tiff</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>(Of course I&#8217;m just posting this. So, the date this was written was a bit ago and the dates we were in the ER were August 2nd and July 26th)</p>
<p>Thankfully, we were not in the ER today. But, we spent time there twice within the last two weeks, one week apart exactly. Why? You ask? Because Isabellas <a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/g-tube.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Gtube</a> keeps falling out!</p>
<p>For me, blogging has been very therapeutic and helps me get my thoughts organized. Having a daughter with numerous health issues is overwhelming. One of the things I found when we lived in the NICU is that there are lots of resources about preemies but not many about G tube&#8217;s. So, I decided to begin blogging about her G-tube journey so that other moms might find it useful. This is also a great way to keep family and friends updated.</p>
<h2>The Dreaded Day Bella&#8217;s Feeding Tube Fell Out</h2>
<p>Bella has a G-tube and we were trained on it in the NICU. I felt pretty confident about things except for replacing the button at home. I knew it would just take some getting used to. But I&#8217;m quite squeamish and looking into a hole in your baby&#8217;s stomach can certainly freak you out. We&#8217;ve become quite comfortable with this little button. We do hook up to feeds eight times a day. So, when her feeding tube did fall out we were prepared.</p>
<p>It was during her for 4:30pm feed. I noticed Isabellas button looked loose. We were going to vent her which basically means let air out of her belly. She was crying and the button was being pushed out. This is pretty normal so I didn&#8217;t think much of it. When she cries the pressure in her stomach can push the button out. It&#8217;s not really something to be scared about. I mentioned it to Dustin who was with me. He didn&#8217;t think it was anything to worry about and continued hooking her extension to the button. I thought maybe I was being overdramatic and looked away for a second while he hooked her up. Before I knew it I heard him yelp and I looked down and the extension was attached to the button and the button was completely out of her stomach.</p>
<p>I looked down and saw the hole and immediately remembered what to do. Dustin ran and grabbed the emergency kit while I held pressure on the stoma (medical term for hole). Luckily Isabella hadn&#8217;t eaten for awhile so the stomach contents weren&#8217;t pouring out. She was unhappy but didn&#8217;t seem to be in pain. There was a little blood from her granulation tissue but nothing crazy.</p>

You can see the catheter hanging out on her side.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Dustin came in with the emergency kit in his hand. We prepare emergency kits with catheters in them in case the button falls out. It is a short-term fix to keep the hole open until we get to a surgeon who will replace it in the emergency department. Eventually we can switch out the button ourselves but since the hole is still healing, our surgeon instructed us to bring her to the emergency department at Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital. He told us the hole could close within 30 minutes and that it would be painful for them to reopen it. So there certainly is urgency in getting something in the hole to keep it open. There are only three people who are supposed to be able to change the button,  Dr Pittinger his partner, Dr. Andrews, or their surgical resident.</p>
<p>Dustin took the catheter and put a small amount of lube on the ends and inserted it into her hole then using a syringe we filled the end, which is like a balloon, with a measured amount of water to hold it in place. Once we made sure the amount of water was correctly in, I taped gauze around it and attached it to Isabellas shirt to keep it from pulling out.</p>
<p>Dustin ran downstairs to our office in the basement, (he works from home) and told his coworkers he would have to leave for the day. We are really lucky this happened near the end of the night so he didn&#8217;t have to miss a lot of work. We packed everything we needed to drive Akron Children&#8217;s Emergency Department which is an hour and a half away. I made sure we had formula, extra syringes, extra extensions, and all her medications.</p>

<p>We placed her in her carseat and used a button down to pull the extension out and lay it gently beside her. The ride to Akron was pretty uneventful and she actually slept away. She was getting hungry because she didn&#8217;t get her feed. She doesn&#8217;t take anything by mouth so if her G-tube is out we can&#8217;t give her food or her medications. We called family and I also contacted a friend who is bringing us dinner. We told her to still bring it and Dustin&#8217;s parents would pick it up and put it in the house for us. They were already planning on being over because they have been mowing our lawn for us!  On the way I called the Emergency Department and told them about Isabella and they contacted Dr Pittinger and his surgical resident. We explained Isabella was medically fragile and they said they would be ready for us when we arrived.</p>

<h2>Why&#8217;d It Fall Out?</h2>
<p>The feeding button fell out because the balloon holding it inside of Bella&#8217;s tummy deflated. This can happen if the button is old, punctured, or if the water is evaporating. To be honest we&#8217;re not sure why Bella&#8217;s button deflated completely. We asked the surgeon and they don&#8217;t know either. This was frustrating, but we were happy to know she had a new button in.</p>

<h2>Best Emergency Department Visit Ever</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s strange going back to Akron Children&#8217;s Emergency Department because we lived in the same building for over 100 days. The NICU is on the sixth and seventh floor. When we staying in Isabellas room up there, I remember countless hours staring out at the city and listening to the ambulances go in and out from the Emergency Department. We knew the area like the back of her hand. We walked into the Emergency Department and as soon as we said her name we were ushered back quickly into a room where they did an intake on Bella. Then they took us to a private room and the surgeon walked in with in six minutes. They ordered as a new button change kit,  even though we had our own (which saved time). It was nice that they moved so urgently.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2181" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9093.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2181 size-shareaholic-thumbnail" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9093-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9093-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9093-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9093.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Isabella lays on the hospital bed, waiting with the catheter in for her button to be replaced. You can see the red marks where the tape was pulled off. Here she has her catheter in.</figcaption></figure>
<p>All the while, Bella was getting pretty hungry. The resident walked in, sterilized, gloved up, asked  a few questions and began assessing Bella. He asked if we wanted to put it back in, but we said no. I felt it was too far away from the official &#8220;heal&#8221; date of August 22nd. I also felt that if there was something wrong he would be able to tell. Within a few quick minutes he pulled the catheter out and inserted the new MiniOne button. Bella cried a bit when he accidentally tugged on the catheter, not realizing it was inflated inside her stomach (rolls eyes).</p>
<p>It was a quick quick thing. The button is inserted and then filled with water to keep it in place inside her stomach. You have to measure the water correctly so that you know how much is inflated inside of her. For Bella, her balloon takes 2.5mls. After awhile you memorize it and know to check it to make sure it has the right amount. Isabella doesn&#8217;t seem to be in pain during the change and was just annoyed someone was bugging her and hungry. As soon as we go the new button in, the surgeon made sure it the placement was correct by pushing fluid in and taking it out of the tubing.</p>

You can see the fluid and granulation tissue.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We were able to stay in the private room to feed Bella. To feed her on the go, or in this case, an emergency, we put her speciality formula into a 60ml syringe and attach it to her extension cord. We then push the formula into her stomach slowly. She doesn&#8217;t tolerate this well and usually throws up. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t have time to fully pack the pump.</p>

<h2>They Know Us</h2>
<p>We were exhausted. We ran out of the house in a rush and were hitting the wall. We were so glad the ER visit took so little time and we were home before 9:00pm, but we were hungry. We walked in and saw a gift bag for us. Our friends Molly and Anthony Pingitore and their precious girls had prepared us dinner. We had a delicious chicken casserole, salad, cookie dough and green beans! While we prepared to feed Bella again we opened the sweetest card from them. Dustin and I both tried to hold back tears. It said lovely things and also had gifts for us. A gift card to Sephora for me and a gift card to Chipotle for Dustin.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2180" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9092.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="wp-image-2180 size-shareaholic-thumbnail" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9092-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9092-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9092-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9092.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bella sleeping after her button is changed.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We fell into the couch after sanitizing and digged into a delicious meal. We both prayed out loud over Bella and our family. I know Molly and Anthony provided these things but I just felt the biggest hug from God himself. Not only did he provide the necessities (dinner), he provided chocolate chip cookie dough (we each grabbed some raw) AND a special gift for each of us. This was a very thoughtful gift since money&#8217;s rather tight and I don&#8217;t just go shopping for makeup. My foundation was running low and I wanted a new lipstick for my friends wedding. God used Molly to provide such a fun &#8220;extra&#8221; gift. That&#8217;s what I love about our Jesus. He cares about the little details that make us US. Thank you Molly and Anthony for allowing the Holy Spirit to work through you and for being so generous.</p>

<p>The rest of the week we also received some amazing meals and gifts from others too! God&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p>Anyway, as soon as we took a sigh of relief, and things felt &#8220;in control&#8221; a week later to the day her button fell out again and we did the trip/process all over again. This time, though, we got some good information and (spoiler) approval to change the button out at home from now on! See Part 2!</p>
<p>I love you all,</p>
<p>XOXO Tiff</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="rte">
<p>Easter and Spring is officially right around the corner! As the weather is warming up and my coffee order turns from hot to iced, my mind is on bright colors and outdoor fun. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re ever too old for gifts and bright colors. For this fun DIY, I decided to mix both. With some of my girlfriends in mind, I made these &#8220;Mason Jar Easter Friend Gifts.&#8221; Every single thing I purchased was found at the Dollar Tree and they only took a few minutes to put together. The best part in my opinion? The mason jars have glass handles so they&#8217;re more like summer mugs &#8211; perfect for iced drinks in the warmer weather.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0135_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1137" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0135_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0135_large" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0135_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0135_large-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0135_large-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>I began with some adorable mason jar mugs I bought. I didn&#8217;t bother to remove the sticker on the bottom. I&#8217;m not as OCD as some other DIYers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, I thought about what would go in my adorable Easter basket-esque Mason Jars. Along with the traditional candy, I wanted to add some items my friends could use everyday. I also wanted to keep the colors the same to make it look extra cool. My main focus was on a yellow, bright gift. I made sure each item I purchased had a yellow option. I bought:</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0140_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1139" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0140_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0140_large" width="480" height="333" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0140_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0140_large-300x208.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0140_large-30x21.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>-Hair elastics</p>
<p>-Neon pencils</p>
<p>-Neon mini gel pens</p>
<p>-Paper straws</p>
<p>I figured the girls could always use writing utensils, the paper straws would be perfect for the mason jar glasses, and your hair always needs to be put back in the warmer weather so the elastic bands were the perfect touch. I also kept in mind the size of the jars and the size of the bright Easter eggs I purchased.</p>

<p>It was a little bit of a struggle to find yellow candy! I picked M&amp;Ms, Butterfingers, and Juicy Fruit. Other candy not pictured included Sixlets, Taffy, and candy necklaces.</p>

<p>Of course you can&#8217;t have a gift that&#8217;s inspired by Spring/Easter without this fake grass stuff! I began by stuffing some in the bottom of the glasses.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0148_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1147" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0148_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0148_large" width="318" height="480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0148_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 318w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0148_large-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0148_large-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0148_large-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></a></p>
<p>You may need to take a pencil or longer object to stuff it in.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0149_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0149_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0149_large" width="318" height="480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0149_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 318w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0149_large-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0149_large-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0149_large-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></a></p>
<p>Once all the fake grass is in, it&#8217;s up to you and your creativity to fill the jar up with color coordinated/or not so coordinated items.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0150_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1150" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0150_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0150_large 2" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0150_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0150_large-2-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0150_large-2-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>I thought a yellow elastic hair tie would work well in the smaller yellow Easter eggs.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0151_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1152" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0151_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0151_large 2" width="318" height="480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0151_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 318w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0151_large-2-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0151_large-2-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0151_large-2-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></a><br />
I also had a little yellow gel pen ready after placing some paper straws (aren&#8217;t they cool) and a neon yellow pencil in.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0154_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1155" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0154_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0154_large" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0154_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0154_large-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0154_large-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>The candy was ready, too!</p>

<p>Silly kitty, this gift isn&#8217;t for you!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0156_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1158" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0156_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0156_large 2" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0156_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0156_large-2-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0156_large-2-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>If an item doesn&#8217;t match the color scheme, like these Sixlets, I placed them in a yellow egg!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0162_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1160" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0162_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0162_large 2" width="318" height="480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0162_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 318w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0162_large-2-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0162_large-2-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0162_large-2-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></a></p>
<p>Once the jar is filled, it&#8217;s ready for giving! After I was done, I realized a little tag that says &#8220;For You&#8221; would be really nice. I added more fake yellow grass and made sure there was no empty space in the jar. What a cup of sunshine!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0165_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1164" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0165_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0165_large" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0165_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0165_large-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0165_large-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>I had planned to do three filled with yellow items, but I remembered my one friend loved pink. Since I had a lot of pink items&#8230;I went ahead and did a different color theme!</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0171_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1165" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0171_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0171_large 2" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0171_large-2.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0171_large-2-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0171_large-2-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>Hot pink rules. I placed the hair tie inside the pink egg. Don&#8217;t you love the mini gel pen?</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0172_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1170" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0172_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0172_large" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0172_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0172_large-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0172_large-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re 10 or 30&#8230;Disney Princesses rock. So do candy bracelets. My bestie Jess will love this.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0175_large-3.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1172" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0175_large-3.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0175_large 3" width="318" height="480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0175_large-3.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 318w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0175_large-3-199x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 199w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0175_large-3-20x30.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 20w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0175_large-3-300x453.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></a></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have pink grass, but you still get the idea of the color scheme. To make this gift more personalized you could write the recipient&#8217;s name in sharpie on the cup.</p>
<p><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0183_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1175" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0183_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="DSC_0183_large" width="480" height="318" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0183_large.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0183_large-300x199.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0183_large-30x20.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>Behind the scenes picture&#8230;the kitty loved bedding down on the fake grass.</p>
<p>Since the mason jars didn&#8217;t have a ton of room, I had extra supplies. I thought outside of the &#8220;Easter basket box&#8221; and used little clear plastic punch cups for mini baskets. These will be given to a few of our family members.</p>

<p>Happy Easter Friends!</p>
<p>This was a memorable Easter for me. Dustin and I attended the Maundy Thursday service at our church. It&#8217;s been an interesting development for me as a Christ-follower because I never celebrated this day. In fact, NONE of the churches I attended had a service dedicated to this day. So, the last few years we&#8217;ve been learning about Maundy Thursday and what it means. Basically, Maundy Thursday is the day when Jesus and his disciples went to the upper room and had communion and he washed their feet. (And yes, even some Christians think it&#8217;s strange that we do this)</p>
<p>Maundy is Latin. It comes from mandatum, which means &#8220;command.&#8221;</p>
<h1>Washing My Husband&#8217;s Feet. It&#8217;s Awkward As It Sounds.</h1>
<p>We were asked to serve and as most things go at Mosaic, our church,  (on the fly) we found out once we arrived we may be needed to wash feet. Now, the whole thing is awkward. Anyone who tells you different has either 1.) been doing it a long time or 2.) isn&#8217;t aware of social norms in the 21rst century!</p>
<p>You&#8217;re on your knees. You&#8217;re touching someone&#8217;s (you may not know) feet. <strong>You&#8217;re not sure if you should scrub it, rub it, or go in-between the toes. It&#8217;s vulnerable and sacred and scary all at the same time. </strong></p>
<p>So, we embraced the command and followed in Jesus&#8217; footsteps and washed others feet. Men on one side, women on the other. We pour water over the feet, rub it a bit, and then dry it with a fresh towel. It&#8217;s all very hygienic and you don&#8217;t have to worry about the man in the back with athlete&#8217;s foot since we don&#8217;t share water. It takes a minute or two. Getting your feet washed is just as humbling as washing. It&#8217;s a very special moment.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t get a chance to wash anyones feet at first because all the women were doing one another&#8217;s. Dustin, on the other hand, was on his knees at the first pew washing from the beginning. It was a very special thing to watch him serve his brothers in Christ and reflect Jesus. At the end, I felt as if I should wash his feet, a prodding from the Holy Spirit. It&#8217;s a strange feeling and I&#8217;ll be honest:<strong> I didn&#8217;t want to do it.</strong> I touch his feet all the time (rubbing them, laying on the couch, etc) but it was awkward. I still knew it was important and would be a very special way to pray over him and  humble myself.</p>
<p>So, we washed each other&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>It was a super sweet moment. One I will never forget. To follow in the footsteps of our Father and submit to one another in love. Phenomenal. I prayed prayers as I touched his feet. God, give him strength. Give him Hope. Give him more and more love for you. Before long, we switched and he washed my feet. It was a very intimate moment.</p>
<p>I had a good understanding of washing feet before engaging in this symbolic ritual, but others may not.</p>

<h1>Why Do We Wash Each Other&#8217;s Feet As Believers?</h1>
<p>Today, as I was reading my devotional, I was shocked to come across the passage where Jesus washes the disciples feet. Now, I do a devotional at random. It&#8217;s not a date specified book and is a book about prayer. It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lifeway.com/Product/whispers-of-hope-p005567167?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Whispers of Hope by Beth Moore.</a> When I came across this section, I was encouraged. God knows I needed a reminder again about why we wash feet.</p>
<p>The passage can be found in John 13. If you take the time to read it, (and I encourage you to do so) it paints the story of Jesus washing his best friends and confidant&#8217;s feet. It says &#8220;he loved them to the end(John 13:1)&#8221; and &#8220;knew that the Father has put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God. (13:1)&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a simple process. He &#8220;poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ok, so, Jesus did this. Why do we? He was doing this with his disciples, why do I need to do it for others and my family? The answer is in verse 14.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another&#8217;s feet. I have set an example that you should do as I have done for you. Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Washing feet is a symbol. It&#8217;s not just about washing feet. It&#8217;s about humbling yourself both ways and allowing someone to serve you or serving another in a very real, raw, awkward way. It&#8217;s about putting someone before yourself.</p>
<p>We can wash other&#8217;s feet everyday without picking up a basin of water. Simply by putting others needs in front of your own is obeying this command.</p>
<p>Today, while I make the bed, mix up some lunch, or kiss my husband I&#8217;m reminded that I can wash his feet and humble myself like Jesus without physically washing his feet every day. Who in your life can you serve and put before yourself?</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>My Sephora Gift Card Giveaway just ended! When I began this blog, I wanted to host a giveaway to get my blog noticed and to give back to those who have supported me in this journey. I scoured the internet to find the best way to host a giveaway. I didn&#8217;t know much going into it other than:</p>
<h4>1. I didn&#8217;t want to pay to host a giveaway on my site.</h4>
<h4>2. It needed to be super simple.</h4>
<p>Dustin, my techy husband looked too. After a few days I decided to try <a href="https://www.rafflecopter.com?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Rafflecopter</a>. This company has a free giveaway option. Of course there&#8217;s an up sell, ( I didn&#8217;t use these options, but you can check out their site for more information) but overall it was super helpful for a new blogger like myself.</p>
<p>To begin, Rafflecopter is free but you have to sign up. Once you sign up you can host as many giveaways as you&#8217;d like. According to the website, Rafflecopter began in 2011 as a free application and later added extras. Here are the basic steps I went through for my giveaway:</p>
<h2>1. Signed up for Rafflecopter</h2>
<p>This is a super easy step. You basically <a href="https://www.rafflecopter.com/?home&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">sign up</a> by giving them your email and then you&#8217;re given a dashboard where you can keep track of your giveaways. There isn&#8217;t an upfront fee or anything. It&#8217;s free.</p>
<h2>2. Purchased a $50 Gift Card from Sephora</h2>
<p>You need to decide what you want to giveaway. I chose to giveaway a Sephora gift card since my blog is primarily about makeup and beauty. I went ahead and purchased it before beginning the giveaway. This is a pretty simple step. <strong>Think about what a large audience would be interested in.</strong> Don&#8217;t pick something too specific. Gift cards work well because people can buy whatever they want with them. Also make sure there are many stores throughout the United States. My gift card also comes with a complimentary makeover at <a href="http://www.sephora.com/?om_mmc=ppc-GG&amp;mkwid=sAUTwFNBV&amp;pcrid=56327149457&amp;pdv=c&amp;site=us_search&amp;country_switch=us&amp;lang=en&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjw7_mrBRDH4Y2UjLHEmfcBEiQA8OTHf0TiXO9p4sJxgkrGzIqihoMGGr1VtoGDLnc4d5ZfG0EaAiVv8P8HAQ&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">Sephora </a>and a little mirror for your purse.</p>
<h2>3. Decided What I Wanted Wy Entries to Be</h2>
<p>I personally think this was the most difficult part. Rafflecopter allows you to pick how people can enter your giveaway. Some of the options are only available for those who have more advanced subscriptions. I picked only the free options. Some of them included following my blog on Twitter, tweeting a message, commenting on a blog post, sharing a blog post on Facebook, following me on Instagram, and liking my blog&#8217;s Facebook page. You can create custom entries too and then assign them a number. For instance, just tweeting a tweet was only 3 entires while commenting on a blog post was 5 entries. People will want to do all of the activities so that they will get more entries.</p>
<p>Rafflecopter allows you to make people &#8220;prove&#8221; that they did the steps. In this case, you can have them link to the Facebook post they shared or offer up their Instagram ID so you can make sure they follow you. I decided to begin building my email subscription and offered entries if you gave your email.</p>
<p>You can also chose if people could perform an entry multiple times. I allowed that if someone shared something once a day they could get more entires.</p>
<h2>4. Decided How Long the Giveaway Would Last</h2>
<p>Since this was my vert first giveaway and there were many different ways to enter, I decided to have the giveaway last a month. <strong>Looking back, I think I should&#8217;ve made it a little bit shorter.</strong> I got distracted and didn&#8217;t keep up with it as much as I should&#8217;ve. Of course this did give people more time to enter it. Rafflecopter lets you pick when it starts and when it ends.</p>
<h2>5. Posted It On My Blog</h2>
<p>As someone who doesn&#8217;t know a lot about coding, I was nervous about this part. I remembered a few friends had used Rafflecopter and the site promised it was super simple to post on your blog. Well, it was! All you do is copy the code and paste it anywhere in your blog text. To embed it, just go to the &#8220;text&#8221; version of your blog post instead of &#8220;visual&#8221; and paste it where you want it. Once I pasted it, the little giveaway box popped up where people could enter. Rafflecopter also lets you post it on a Facebook fan page.</p>
<h2>6. Tried to Keep Up with Promotion</h2>
<p>This was the hardest part for me. I went on two vacations when the giveaway was being held and I didn&#8217;t write any new posts for my site. I noticed I got a lot of entries at the beginning, but near the end it began losing steam. The most entries I received were from Facebook. I&#8217;m pretty active on there and have a lot of friends and family. Along with Facebook I added it on Twitter and on Instagram. There was little interaction on those platforms. My husband also paid to have it promoted on a giveaway site. I&#8217;m not sure of the details of that but will write about it at a later time. He paid $5 I think of Fiverr.</p>
<h2>7. Emailed &amp; Announced the Winner</h2>
<p>Rafflecopter reminded me by email when it was a few weeks out and then before it ended. This helped me in posting it on Facebook and other places. At the very end I logged in and chose a random winner. The woman who won had followed me on Instagram and is from another state. It was easy because I emailed her through Rafflecopter and announced it on the plug-in as well. The next day she responded with her address and thanked me.</p>
<h2>8. Got A Spreadsheet with All the Entries</h2>
<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that Rafflecopter also gives you access to a spreadsheet with all the entires! This is such a great resource because I can see everyone who entered and all the information they provided for their entries. On the spreadsheet is also their collected email addresses (if they gave it to me for my email list). I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;m going to use all of this information, but I know it will be handy in the future as I develop the blog more. I had over 2,000 entries!</p>
<p>Here are my last running numbers:</p>
<p>-2,881 entries (Each person could earn about 31 entries)</p>
<p>-it ran a month</p>
<p>Once I review the other information I&#8217;ll have more numbers for you. Ex: How many individuals entered to win. How many people I personally knew entered.</p>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>I learned a lot! For $50, I was happy to give back to the blogging community and also get my blog out there. Here are my main takeaways:</p>
<p>-go with a gift card, not something too specific</p>
<p>-choose a dollar amount that&#8217;s worth someone&#8217;s time</p>
<p>-don&#8217;t pay money to host a giveaway if you&#8217;re beginning</p>
<p>-promote the giveaway daily on social media</p>
<p>-consider buying advertisement on Fiverr</p>
<p>-have fun!</p>
<p>Have any other suggestions or questions? Feel free to add your thoughts below!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>

<p>My great grandma is in her 90s and lives in Florida. I try to visit as much as I can but haven&#8217;t seen her since last May. Unfortunately, she has really bad hearing and a phone call is difficult. About a year ago, I began writing her little cards and notes to update her on our life. <strong>Little did I know that it became such a special thing for her.</strong> When she&#8217;s at home, she can get bored and lonely. A little fun card in the mail or a small package really makes her day seem magical.</p>
<h3><strong>It&#8217;s also helped me think outside of myself.</strong> Sometimes we can become so self-centered. This little habit of writing a card to my grandma helps me remember to be thankful for what I have and where I&#8217;m at in life.</h3>
<p>For this month, I was inspired by <a href="http://happymoneysaver.com/send-a-box-of-sunshine-to-brighten-someones-day/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank">&#8220;a box of sunshine&#8221; that I saw on Pinterest.</a> A few years ago a friend was dealing with some really scary stuff and had to have brain surgery. While she was recovering I grabbed anything yellow that I thought she&#8217;d enjoy at the store and packaged it up. It meant a lot to her and I&#8217;m sure it made her smile. As the sun began peeking out of the clouds this month, I decided to send other boxes of sunshine to my great grandma, grandma, and little sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Most the items were less than $1 and the bright yellow bag was only 25 cents at Walmart. I used the bags to gather the materials inside an envelope to mail out. They look like little goodie bags. You can also purchase yellow shredded paper to add some fun to the package. A little does go a long way though! (We had it everywhere in the house and had to keep the kitties from eating it) Yellow shredded paper filler is available at the dollar tree. I had at least 1/2 the bag left after putting together these happy mail packages.</p>

<p>When I was putting together the happy mail packages, I tried to think of each person. Would they enjoy a notebook? How would they use the printable? My grandma reads her Bible every morning and likes to use bookmarks. This fun little printable can help hold her place or she can put it up on the fridge. I also know my great grandma loves chocolate. She would be someone that would love the Reese&#8217;s Egg.</p>
<p>I picked out the two printable&#8217;s I found on Pinterest. I simply typed &#8220;free spring printable&#8221; and these came up! When looking for a printable, make sure they really are free and always give credit to whom you use them from.</p>
<p>Here are the ones featured in this project:</p>

<p>Can you think of someone in need of a little spring cheer? This type of happy mail project is simple and doesn&#8217;t need to cost a lot. I choose to print the printables at the UPS store on cardstock but you can do it right at home. Also, it&#8217;s fun to have a sense of humor about the gift too! The Wooly Willy boards are fun and quirky. I picked them up at Walmart in their Easter section.</p>

<p>You can include as much (or as little) as you&#8217;d like in your happy mail gift. As you can see by the pictures, you can mix and match items and find the perfect fit for the recipient. I placed the goodies in my yellow bags and then tucked them into bubble mailers. I think shipping for a few light items will be between $3-4. I also wrote cards and included a fun few photographs. Whenever Walgreens has a picture printing deal (less than 10 cents each) I buy a lot of photos of our house, us, the cats, etc. My great grandma loves to get pictures of us since she doesn&#8217;t use Facebook or other social media.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to give more happy mail, keep a list of items you&#8217;d like to send/receive on your iPhone or in your wallet. As you shop at the Dollar Tree or Target, keep an eye out for sale and clearance items that you can add to your happy mail stash. The more items you have acquired, the cheaper and easier the process of sending mail will be. I always keep an eye out for sale bubble mailers with pretty designs and buy tissue paper in bulk!  If you can&#8217;t think of anyone you know personally that needs Happy Mail, call your local nursing home or church and ask for referrals. Chances are, there are widows or others in need that you can give happy mail to!</p>
<p>Have a splendid spring!</p>
<p>Love &amp; Laughter,</p>
<p>Tiffany</p>
<p>Bonus: These are ready to mail out!</p>
