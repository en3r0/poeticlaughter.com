<p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so excited that I was able to have time to be creative over the last month or so. Thanks to my amazing husband and family, I&#8217;ve had a little bit of free time here and there to de-stress and enjoy crafting. I&#8217;ve always loved making things with my hands and baking. With Bella, I haven&#8217;t had a lot of time, energy, or funds to do it! For Christmas I received some awesome craft items from generous family members and I discovered felt quiet books as well!</p>
<h1>Jaxson&#8217;s Quiet Book</h1>
<figure id="attachment_2633" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3025.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-2633" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3025.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="650" height="867" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3025.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3025-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3025-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Jaxson&#8217;s finished quiet book</figcaption></figure>
<p>I learned about Quiet Books and became obsessed with them. I started by teaching myself and cutting everything out and sewing it by hand. In the end I learned how to do a blanket stitch, install grommets (metal rings) and follow free patterns. The other things I knew how to do before.</p>

<p>In the end, I made the following pages:</p>
<p>Cover Page, Tractor, wheels spin</p>
<p>Pizza Page, Pizza slices with pepperoni can be counted and can Velcro onto right spaces</p>
<p>Ice Cream Page, Stack a fun colorful ice cream cone</p>
<p>Farm Pages, Finger puppets with open/close barn doors, Page for puppets to &#8220;play&#8221;</p>
<p>Dump Truck Page, Dump Truck &#8220;empties&#8221; and you can take rock in/out of truck bed</p>
<figure id="attachment_2632" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3020.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-2632" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3020.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="650" height="867" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3020.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3020-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3020-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bella approves</figcaption></figure>
<p>I bound the pages with grommets and binder rings. This way. I can add/subtract to the book. I choose to finish off each page individually so that we could interchange them easier. Believe it or not, I never took pictures of the finished book! I gifted it to Jaxson and forgot to do a video of the book pages. I will have to do that. A lot of these pictures aren&#8217;t or it finished but in different stages. I loved it. It took a lot of time though, and planning!</p>
<h1>Baby Christmas Felt Books</h1>
<figure id="attachment_2637" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3104.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-2637" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3104.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="650" height="867" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3104.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3104-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3104-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Who are these going to?</figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, I decided to make Christmas themed baby felt books. I made a total of 4. They also took more time than I planned! Almost all of these I freehanded but the fox. <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/141706040/Fox-Softie-Pattern#fullscreen?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">I found the pattern here. </a></p>

<p>I really loved how these turned out. I stuck to easy silhouettes and only used embroidery thread and felt. I struggled with binding them, since I didn&#8217;t want to use the grommets or things that could be a choking hazard. I ended up threading them together and tying a knot. For two of them I attached them to little baby links. Of course for Isabella&#8217;s I had to &#8220;sign&#8221; it on the back. Each had 4 pages. They are pretty small. Jaxsons was bigger, but these were meant to be handled by little fingers!</p>

<p>Bella&#8217;s face doesn&#8217;t show it, but I swear she loved it and enjoys the contrast!</p>
<p>I began a baby book (first) when learning but abandoned it because I switched to the Christmas idea. Below is where I began and I&#8217;ll get back to completing it eventually.</p>

<h1>I Got to Bake!</h1>
<p>We have an old German family recipe for lard sugar cookies. Yes, lard! It&#8217;s crazy but really addictive. I&#8217;ve been making and eating them since I was a little girl. We made them with my dad (as always) and I was creative and decorated the ones below.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2630" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2847.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"><img class="size-full wp-image-2630" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2847.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" width="650" height="867" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2847.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2847-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2847-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Beautiful family sugar cookies</figcaption></figure>
<p>I also was able to get my mixer out! I made some quick <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/9471/peanut-butter-cup-cookies/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">peanut butter cup cookies</a>. They were a big hit at our family get togethers. I didn&#8217;t make my fun &#8220;twisted buckeyes&#8221; but may make some for New Years Eve.</p>

<h1>Fleece Blankets</h1>
<p>Money has been a bit tight this year! We cut our budget back by quite a bit. Instead of buying everyone on our list individual gifts, we made everyone a fleece blanket! This was fun because</p>
<p>1.) it was pretty cost effective (no blanket was more than $17 each) <a href="https://www.joann.com/search?q=fleece+kit&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">We bought the kits from Joanns when they were 40% off.Â </a></p>
<p>2.) it gave me something to work on and craft</p>
<p>3.) each was picked out based on the person&#8217;s likes</p>

<p>Everyone liked theirs. They wash up really well (I&#8217;ve washed mine A LOT with Bella vomiting) and I did a different tie which made the prints switch sides. It was more of a &#8220;in/out&#8221; fold instead of a tie. It helped the blankets to lay nicely. I&#8217;m not sure what it&#8217;s called. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3UgR6rKEoE&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">I used this video and cut the notches. </a></p>
<p>This project took longer than I thought as well. Haha. I was rushing around trying to finish them in time. I folded and tied them with yarn.</p>
<h1>I Got A Cricut! And Used It!</h1>

<p>This fun personalized platter was bought at the $ tree! I used my Cricut to cut permanent vinyl for it. I placed my peanut butter cookie cups on it to take to family get togethers.</p>
<p>The mug I made for Dustin was my first attempt. I don&#8217;t love it because it&#8217;s too big, but it held up to our dishwasher and is fun. I will probably redo one and make the design smaller.</p>

<p>I really love the Christmas village I made with cardstock and vinyl. It was one of the &#8220;make it now&#8221; projects. I already had a glittery metal house on my mantel. I added this fun accordion style paper village behind it. You can place tea lights behind it as well to make the windows glow.</p>

<p>Instead of only using white, I added in blue for a pop of color.</p>
<h1>Baby Craft</h1>

<p>I saw this idea on Pinterest and had to try it. I wasn&#8217;t crazy about it, but was bored and wanted to make a Grandparent gifts from the baby. I made a big mistake by getting her toe nails dyed green after applying water color paints! haha The cards weren&#8217;t perfect, but it was a free craft (I had all supplies at home) and I had fun making memories with Bella.</p>
<p>You can see I&#8217;ve been pretty busy crafting! This has helped a lot with stress. It&#8217;s been very fun to work with my hands and make beautiful things.</p>
<p>Hope you had a blessed Christmas,</p>
<p>T</p>

<p>We began overnight continuous feeds recently and it&#8217;s been such a game changer! Isabella has trouble gaining weight and was once slapped with the terrible diagnosis of &#8220;failure to thrive.&#8221; There are many reasons why she can&#8217;t eat by mouth, but for this post I&#8217;ll focus in on what an overnight continuous feed looks like for us.Â </p>

<p>I absolutely love the cute Honest Company diapers with the apples. We haven&#8217;t been able to share the wonder and beauty of Fall with Bella outside, but have decorated and used fun Fall things around the house&#8230;like these diapers.</p>



<h2>Getting Bella Ready For BedÂ </h2>



<p>Before bed, we put Bella in her pajamas and hook her up to her extension set. (I read it was best to attach the tubing to her diaper. I&#8217;ve gone away from that because we change her diaper throughout the night.) What you see here is her Mini One Feeding Tube attached to her extension set. We then give meds and her feed through the extension. The extension is good for an entire week. The feeding bag, which is filled with formula and attaches to the pump, is only good for 24hrs. (Yes, we throw away a pump bag and tubing every single day. It&#8217;s a crazy amount of waste).Â </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-2395" src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1174w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1228-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1174px) 100vw, 1174px" />
<figcaption>Trying overnight feeds the first time</figcaption>
</figure>



<h2>The First Night</h2>



<p>For the first night I had Bella sleep right next to me. I was very nervous about her strangling herself, pulling her button out, or vomiting and choking/aspirating. Here you can see Bella is hooked up to the pump tubing, IV pole, and extension set. It went amazingly. She didn&#8217;t even vomit! I woke up a lot of check on her but she seemed so happy and content. When I woke up I realized I had gotten SO MUCH SLEEP and so had she. It was crazy. I&#8217;m used to only getting 5 hours, interrupted. To switch to 8 hours was a massive blessing.</p>



<h2>Why Do Overnight Feeds Help Isabella?</h2>



<p>Overnight continuous feeds work well because Isabella has GERD (severe acid reflux) and a premature GI system. She is unable to take large volumes of formula at a time via feeding tube without throwing it up or being in pain. The goal of a continuous feed is to ensure she gets the nutrition she needs. The hope is that the very tiny amount of volume she gets per minute will be tolerated well and she will be less likely to vomit with less in her stomach. It also helps that she can rest uninterrupted.Â </p>



<p>Of course this is an added bonus to us! We have been on a &#8220;newborn&#8221; schedule until now (7 months) and her feeds were taking us a minimum of an hour and a half. We would need to hold her upright for an hour during the feed and then another 30 minutes to help prevent vomiting. Even then she would throw up quite a lot. To be completely honest we would bring ice packs to bed with us while feeding her to stay awake. We would blare our TV and talk to each other or watch movies. We couldn&#8217;t fall asleep during her feeds and it was very exhausting. At the time when her vomiting was at its worst we were feeding her 8x a day. To do the feed, hold her, prep the pump, etc, it was 2 hours each time. We literally spent 16 hours a day feeding Bella.Â </p>

<h2>Setting Bella&#8217;s Pump, How Does It Work?</h2>



<p>The pump can be set for different rates and amounts of volume for her to receive. For Bella, we give her 30ml of a specific formula custom for her every hour. That&#8217;s 1/2 an ounce an hour. Or, 1/2ml per minute. It&#8217;s basically like an IV drip, only with formula. We allow this to run from 10pm until 9am. The formula is good to be hung for 4 hours. We wake up 2x to refill the pump bag with fresh formula mixed up and prepped in the fridge.Â </p>

<h2>Why Do You Wake Up?</h2>



<p>We wake up at 2am and 6am. At this time we rewarm a bottle and add the liquid to the pump bag. We also check on Bella&#8217;s tubing, change her diaper, and check for leaking. At 2am I also give her a medication that I push through her tubing with a syringe. At 9am (or later if she&#8217;s still sleeping and we can squeeze a bit extra formula in) her alarm on her pump will sound and I will turn it off. The alarm sounds if the bag is empty, but we set our own alarms. We certainly don&#8217;t want to forget to refill the bag or else the pump will pump air into her belly! That can be very painful for a little one. Above you can see that her Gtube sometimes leaks. We have to change her outfit and sheets when this happens.Â </p>

<h2>Does She Still Eat During The Day?</h2>



<p>Yes! Bella still gets fed 3x during the day. We give her 75ml over an hour at 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm. She gets a little over 1ml an hour. She tolerates it rather well and usually just naps during the 12pm and 4pm feed on my chest. I still have to hold her upright for an hour and a half. Then, at the 8pm feed she falls asleep and stays asleep for the rest of the night. Of course we accidentally wake her to take her to bed and &#8220;hook her up&#8221; but she usually just groggily smiles and then falls back asleep.</p>

<figcaption>Mommy and Me Time!</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>I love feeding Bella. It&#8217;s a very special time. She snuggles up and I have an hour and a half to just be cozy with her. In the beginning I had to do this A LOT (8x a day shared with Dustin). That made it hard to do anything, including making insurance calls and eat. Now it&#8217;s only 2x a day and Dustin does 1. This 3 hours is helpful to slow down and rest. Above is my setup for Bella&#8217;s feeds. I&#8217;m tethered to her and her pump so I make sure to empty my bladder, get anything I want nearby and get comfy! I just finished a fun book called Girl Wash Your Face.Â </p>

<h2>Overnight Feeding Has It&#8217;s Challenges</h2>



<p>So, sleeping almost all night and not waking up every few hours is amazing. It&#8217;s so crazy awesome. BUT, there are some challenges with overnight feeds.</p>



<p>Bella moves around a lot and can pull on her button.</p>



<p>We alter her sleepers if they don&#8217;t have snaps by cutting a hole in them for the tubing. I run these down her leg to help keep her from tugging on the tubing or getting it caught around her neck. It&#8217;s actually pretty hard to find a ton of snap sleepers that are warm! So, we use zipper ones and just alter them ourselves.Â </p>



<p>We just recently began running the tubing through an empty paper towel roll to help keep it from away her head.</p>



<p>Sometimes if the button is pulled she leaks all over herself and the bed. We have to change out her clothing and the bedding.Â </p>



<p>The friction on her button causes her to break out. She can get skin breakdown near her stoma (stomach hole). So we have to keep bandages on it and rash cream to keep it from bleeding.Â </p>



<p>Sometimes I worry about her silently aspirating the formula into her lungs. If she does it silently after vomiting, I have no way of knowing or stopping the pump if I&#8217;m asleep. I&#8217;ve had to simply give this fear to God and trust that Bella is big enough to turn her head and spit formula out.Â </p>

<h2>Overall, It&#8217;s the Right Choice For BellaÂ </h2>



<p>Continuous overnight feeds has certainly helped Bella so much. She still vomits at least once during the night or morning, but it&#8217;s not a lot of formula! Sometimes she&#8217;ll go all night not vomiting and will simply wake up throwing up a small volume! I don&#8217;t even have to change her bedding. For us, this is awesome. She was throwing up 5+ times a night before and not gaining the weight she desperately needed. Now, she seems to be hitting new milestones and seems to rested. We&#8217;ve put off continuous feeds during the day, to keep her from being hooked up all the time, and hope we can keep avoiding it by doing this. We can also avoid certain medications to empty her stomach quicker and a GJ tube which puts formula into her small intestine!Â </p>

<p>Also, note, our bed is made! Thanks to the extra sleep I was getting. I can&#8217;t remember when I took the above pictures, but you better believe the bed is made now almost every day thanks to the restful night and clean bedding with no throw up!Â </p>
