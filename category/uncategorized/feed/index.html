<p>So much is happening. So quick. </p>



<p>I keep seeing people suggesting to &#8220;write your account down.&#8221; Of course it feels sort of &#8230; silly. Are things really that bad? </p>



<p>Yet, they are. </p>



<p>We are experiencing a Pandemic. Our lives will change as we know it. </p>



<p>We are home. We are in self-quarantine. We only go out to get essentials. </p>



<p>So, I thought I would begin blogging about what&#8217;s giving us hope. </p>



<p>What&#8217;s filling our time. In our little corner of the world. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4308.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2881"/><figcaption>I adore our backyard/side yard. </figcaption></figure>



<h3>Cooking </h3>



<p>I&#8217;ve been cooking a lot! We&#8217;ve made some great Home Chef meals and I&#8217;m picking up items to make chocolate chip cookies. </p>



<h3>Outside</h3>



<p>Isabella calls it &#8220;siiide.&#8221; She stands by the front door and begs to go &#8220;&#8216;side.&#8221; We walk around our lot. We have gone on a few walks around the neighborhood. She stops and stares at leaves. There are really pretty purple buds coming up in the lawn. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4450.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2880"/><figcaption>My dad/Jutka got her a Learning Tower for her 2nd birthday. She can help me in the kitchen! </figcaption></figure>



<h3>Family </h3>



<p>We aren&#8217;t seeing any family. We went to see my dad, but only through glass. His wife is in Hungary and he&#8217;s been on a work assignment for the last two weeks. It was so strange to talk to him through his front glass door. But, refreshing to see another human. Mom is planning on stopping by at our window today. We facetime with Jutka in Hungary. She recorded her lullaby and I&#8217;ve been playing it for Bella. I&#8217;ve also been able to do Zoom with Sarah and Jess. That&#8217;s been super encouraging. And, of course, texting friends like Aubrie. </p>



<h3>Learning </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-22-at-1.32.51-PM.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2882"/></figure>



<p>I began taking a lovely free course called <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2018/02/20/yales-most-popular-class-ever-be-available-coursera?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Science of Wellbeing</a> from Yale University. It&#8217;s on Coursea, a free online platform. I&#8217;ve already completed the first week. It&#8217;s very laid back, yet informative. I took a few tests to determine by strengths. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-22-at-1.33.38-PM.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2883"/><figcaption>Top Strengths </figcaption></figure>



<p>I&#8217;m also reading. There are a few books I&#8217;m reading online via <a href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Hoopla</a>, the free library resource. I&#8217;m reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Montessori-Toddler-Parents-Raising-Responsible/dp/152350689X?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Montessori Toddler</a> and a book club recommendation <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sacrament-Novel-Olaf-Olafsson/dp/0062899872/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+sacrament&amp;qid=1584898525&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">The Sacrament.</a> </p>



<p>I think part of my new personal assignment is to blog our experience. Even if it&#8217;s just for my personal reflection, it&#8217;s good to remind myself of the good good things. </p>



<p>Peace &amp; Joy, </p>

<p>When you give birth to a baby that&#8217;s 1 lb 7 ounces you learn to wash your hands. Well. Or use hand sanitizer. Well. </p>



<p>You begin driving around with a full sized sanitizer in your cup holder and avoid larger public places. </p>

<p>So, with COVID-19 hitting Ohio I feel pretty prepared. To be honest we&#8217;ve been in medical isolation for a very long time now. It&#8217;s second nature to our little family of 3. My husband works from home, I stay home, and we don&#8217;t take Bella, our now 2 year old, out very often unless it&#8217;s warm or if the event is worth exposing her to germs. To avoid making this post about my experience and more about tips, I&#8217;ll add a little bit of information that gives me some quarantine street cred. then move on with tips <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_1923.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2862"/><figcaption>Staying in with these two isn&#8217;t too bad!</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Quarantine Street Cred </h3>



<p>Bella was born in March of 2018. For months before that I was on moderate bedrest (homebound) and then spent a week in a high risk unit where I wasn&#8217;t allowed out but once. We stayed in the NICU for about 110 days. After, we isolated until April of 2019. We ONLY went to needed appointments/very limited family member&#8217;s homes. Dustin and I stayed home as much as possible and when we did go out we immediately took our clothes off and showered. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_20190503_192517438.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2871"/><figcaption>My first time at Target with Bella, older than a year!</figcaption></figure>



<p>In April/May of 2019 we finally went out, even slightly against medical advice (They would&#8217;ve loved her to be isolated until the age of 2!) We explored all summer and into the fall, even going to Disney World. Again, come October we began pulling in the reigns and have been in a semi-medical isolation since. On March 1st Bella turned 2 and this past weekend we went to a kids event at the library. Although this has been extremely hard, it&#8217;s also been extremely rewarding and necessary. Isabella has NOT been re-hospitalized since leaving the NICU in May and is thriving. She also received immunity boosting injections both seasons. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_1021.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2854"/><figcaption>Injection information </figcaption></figure>



<h3>Tips That Worked For Me </h3>



<p>So, how did we do it? How did we keep from getting stir-crazy? How did we keep morale up and enjoy (Yes, ENJOY) our time in isolation? I studied other families and dedicated my time to personal growth and hygge principals. Here are some tips that helped me. </p>



<h3>Recognize That You&#8217;ll Be In Isolation &amp; Make A Plan </h3>



<p>As soon as I learned I would be homebound and was considered high-risk with my pregnancy, I jumped online. I researched and learned what had worked for other moms in my situation. I learned that having a plan and routine would save my sanity. I also learned that setting up goals and accepting that I would be at home would help. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_1938.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2852"/><figcaption>A cup of coffee &#038; my favorite magazine! </figcaption></figure>



<p>I grabbed a little basket called my &#8220;bed rest&#8221; basket and stocked it with medications, a notebook, a Bible, pens, scripture cards, lip balm, lotion, and other things that would be good to have close at hand. I then filled my notebook with things I wanted to get &#8220;done&#8221;. These things included resuming my goal of watching the Top 100 Movies of All Time, finishing a digital scrapbook, and reading 2-3 books that I had put off. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_5335.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2869"/><figcaption>Reading about other&#8217;s hard situations helped. This book is excellent!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Again, once we realized we would be in isolation after having Bella, we sat down and wrote 10 goals for the year. A lot of these were limited to our home. Some examples included finishing Bella&#8217;s baby book, planning a fun first birthday party, learning about Montessori Education, and organizing my closet. Dustin set out to make money from a blog and learn a song on the guitar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3352.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2865"/><figcaption>Some great essentials; lip balm, sleepy lotion, face cream, and essential oils</figcaption></figure>



<p>So, what to do if you&#8217;re going to be in quarantine for a bit? Grab a notebook and write out some goals. What are a few things that you have been putting off? Or would like to explore? Once you have a fun guide written down, let it help guide your next few weeks. </p>



<h3>Reach Out &amp; Continue To Build Relationships </h3>



<p>As soon as I learned that my life with a micropreemie would look very different than other mommas, I made a commitment to continue to build relationships&#8230;from afar. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_1534.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2861"/><figcaption>Bella and I twinning</figcaption></figure>



<p>I continued to text/message/facetime others. I learned to be vulnerable online and in my text communications. I also even attended a few gatherings via Facetime/Skype! </p>



<p>To continue relationship building with other moms, I would ask about their kids, share photos, and pray for them. I also joined the digital MOPs (Moms of Preschoolers) group. This helped me as I received weekly emails and other types of encouragement, like texts. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_1066.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2856"/><figcaption>This little cutie was fun to stay at home with</figcaption></figure>



<p>As many of you know, I utilized social media to build relationships and to share about our struggles. This helped me build online friends and also helped me &#8220;vent.&#8221; Eventually once out of isolation, I committed to having a friend over once a month to meet Bella. It was challenging since I had been in isolation for a year (or more) but very rewarding. </p>



<h3>Explore New Hobbies </h3>



<p>Exploring a new hobby can sound cliche, but, let me tell you, trying something new can be super fun and energizing! Last Christmas my dad got me a Cricut Explore Air 2 as a gift. Other family members bought me accessories. I was excited to learn a new craft system. The cost of supplies was expensive, but I looked online for discounts and took a few Hobby Lobby runs to pick up paper. (Always using that 40% digital coupon!) </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3121.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2864"/><figcaption>I made this fun Christmas village with paper! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Before long, I was creating cards, decor, banners, and more! I was even able to make Bella&#8217;s first birthday invites myself. I loved watching Youtube tutorials and learning new techniques. When Bella would nap, I would pull out my Cricut and create little things. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_2443.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2863"/><figcaption>I also created fun little felt books for friends and Bella</figcaption></figure>



<p>This made me happy and I felt good about learning something new. One of my goals was to create t-shirts. At the end of the season I had made us T-shirts for our upcoming Disney trip AND I had made some for friends. Later, once out of isolation, I shared my love of Cricut with friends. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3357.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2858"/><figcaption>Hygge banner I made! </figcaption></figure>



<h3>Learn/Embrace a Hygge Lifestyle </h3>



<p>Hygge is certainly a trendy word and concept! Wikipedia defines it,</p>



<p><em><strong>Hygge</strong></em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">/ˈh(j)uːɡə/</a>; Danish: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Danish?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">[ˈhykə]</a>; Norwegian: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Norwegian?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">[ˈhŷɡːə]</a>) is a Danish and Norwegian word for a mood of coziness and comfortable conviviality with feelings of wellness and contentment. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ACS_0006.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2875" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/acs_0006-2/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2875"/><figcaption>surrounded by family photos</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ACS_0005.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2859" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/acs_0005-2/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2859"/><figcaption>creating a fun mantle with candles </figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_2944.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2857" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/img_2944/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2857"/><figcaption>neutrals kept things calm </figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3375.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2866" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/img_3375/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2866"/><figcaption>a layered cozy bed</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>I learned about this concept through Youtube videos and a few books. My favorite was The Little Book of Hygge by Meik Wiking. I listened to it FREE from the online Library app Hoopla with Bella. This book challenged me to slow down and embrace being indoors. I hung twinkle lights, layered on cozy blankets, read, and lit lots of candles. Hygge became my favorite thing about being in isolation. I made lots of tea, organized my mug collection, and cuddled our infant for hours. Looking back, this time became very special in my memory and I&#8217;m glad I discovered this practice. Learning about it and practicing it can bring much joy and peace. </p>



<h3>Pet Your Cat </h3>



<p>I&#8217;m a crazy cat lady at heart. And in practice. We own 3 cats. Each have their own fun personality. During isolation I learned to just sit and pet them.  (The ones that allowed me to).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_2934.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2853"/><figcaption>City Kitty, the OG</figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s a strange thing to sit and be still and play or pet your cat, but it&#8217;s relaxing and has health benefits! Some nights I&#8217;d play with the cats and just enjoy them in our home. I practiced having them sit on my lap/chest and watch TV. The cats loved the extra attention and so did I. </p>



<h3>Make Mental Health a Priority</h3>



<p>Being isolated and dealing with Bella&#8217;s health issues was extremely taxing on my emotional health. I began therapy and upped my anxiety medication. Since 15 I have been diagnosed with Anxiety, Panic Disorder, and Depression. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_3316.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2844"/><figcaption>Cuddling Bella and Teddy</figcaption></figure>



<p>I remember one day sitting on the kitchen floor sobbing. I told Dustin I could&#8217;t do it anymore. I&#8217;m not sure what I was referring to in that moment, but it was my surrender. I needed additional support. I needed help. Even though money was tight I shared that I NEEDED therapy. I began therapy the next week and continued to go once a month. This hour truly helped me get over the hump of isolation and fear. </p>



<p>I&#8217;m not one for taking on debt, but if that&#8217;s something you have to do to get what you need to be healthy, do it. We were gifted money so that I could make my health a priority. I&#8217;m so thankful we took advantage of the opportunity. Now, I am a much better mother and person because of it. There are many opportunities now for online therapy from home.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_0816.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2860"/><figcaption>Organizing my space helped me feel good </figcaption></figure>



<p>Also, continue to take any mental health medications. I have stayed on top of taking my daily dose of Zoloft which has helped tremendously. This also includes staying on top of refills. Ask a relative or friend to help remind you to get your refills on time. </p>



<h3>Look For Creative Alternatives To Activities  </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_1726.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2873"/><figcaption>A fun Date Night in! All the essentials to create a meal together and stay in for a cozy weekend (or months)! </figcaption></figure>



<p>When the world seems dark or your world seems dark it can help to think outside the box. </p>



<p>We were scared with Bella. Every cough or sneeze could jeopardize her life. We overcame worry with hope. We overcame sadness with joy. We sought out healthy alternatives. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_5172.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2855"/><figcaption>Bella, with the sign we were given. </figcaption></figure>



<p>I remember we couldn&#8217;t get out for Christmas in 2018. I was crying. I was sad seeing others out and enjoying events and Zoo Lights. Oh, what I would give to go to zoo lights! (We got to go the next year!) Instead, we grabbed a coupon and got coffee. We went in our Pjs and drove around town looking at the lights and playing Christmas music. It&#8217;s now one of my favorite memories of that difficult time. I remember we only had a few hours between Bella&#8217;s pump feeds but it was magical. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2371" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9172-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Sarah meeting Bella through our glass door</figcaption></figure>



<p>Other fun ideas:</p>



<p>Picnic Inside &#8211; Lay out a picnic with a blanket and fun snacks/lunch. </p>



<p>Obstacle Course &#8211; Create a fun obstacle course with couch cushions. </p>



<p>Facetime Play Date &#8211; Have a virtual play date! Facetime a friend and have the kids say hello and play with the fun filters. * I did this a TON with family. It helped me feel connected. </p>

<h3>Learn To Cook</h3>



<p>There&#8217;s something so calming and cozy about creating a meal. While we were in, I looked forward to creating meals for my family. I would have my husband watch Bella and I would chop, hum, and dance around our little kitchen. My favorite Pandora station was &#8220;Jazz Dinner&#8221; and I loved filling our home with yummy scents. I didn&#8217;t cook every night, but when I did I would double the recipe so we could eat leftovers. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2867"/><figcaption>Banana Bread! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Although I knew how to cook before having Bella, learning to cook new things was a great time investment! I would pick out a few new recipes and try my hand at them each month. I really fell in love with Sheet Pan Dinners and Crockpot Meals all over again! As I worked my way around the kitchen, I saved our winning recipes. I have a great collection of winning dinners that are healthy, quick, and delicious. </p>



<h3>Plan A Trip </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_6597.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2874"/><figcaption>Bella and I at Balloonfest! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Eventually we will be able to leave the house. Whether that&#8217;s a few months from now, or a year, in our case previously, we WILL get to be back among society. It was hard to plan anything with a medically fragile infant that needed pump fed every 3 hours. We were exhausted and desperate to get out of the house. On top of that, money was tight. How could we plan a trip? Why would I suggest this? </p>



<p>Well, because of HOPE. Investing your time into planning a trip is very therapeutic. Whenever life would feel too hard or I would want to get out of our little home, I&#8217;d &#8220;travel.&#8221; I&#8217;d hop on Pinterest or Instagram and indulge my wanderlust. I began saving cool things to do for my bucketlist and had fun pricing out month long trips to Venice, Italy and the South of France. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_5984.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2870"/><figcaption>Bella out and about with her new (nicer) sign</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although I haven&#8217;t done any of those specific trips since being out of isolation&#8230;I&#8217;ve enjoyed learning about travel and &#8220;exploring&#8221; from my couch. Later, after we received some unexpected money, we were able to invest in a trip to Florida (and Disney World) as a family. I had so much fun planning every little detail and budgeting toward our first big family adventure. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0088.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2808"/><figcaption>Meeting Mickey &#038; Minnie</figcaption></figure>



<p>Begin by browsing Pinterest or Instagram. What countries excite you? Is there a place you&#8217;ve always wanted to go? For us, we got to visit Ireland in 2017. We adored it and dream of taking Bella with us again (she was in my tummy while there). I look back on photobooks and also play music from our trip. This keeps my spirits up and gives our family a fun goal. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_5936.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2872"/><figcaption>Feeding Bella on the first week she was able to get out! </figcaption></figure>



<p>No matter how long you find yourself in quarantine, there&#8217;s hope. We have a God that&#8217;s much much bigger than this. He will sustain us. </p>



<p>Light &amp; Love, </p>



<p>T</p>

<p>I like to reflect and re-focus each year. A few years ago Dustin and I began writing out goals for each year. </p>



<h4>These goals reflected who we wanted to be and what we wanted to value in the next year. </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9030.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2788"/><figcaption>Dustin with Bella at Beasts Castle </figcaption></figure>



<h3>It’s so funny how it’s easy to lose sight of your goals and become “responsive” to life around you instead of living each day with intention.&nbsp;</h3>



<h3>Since doing these lists, we haven’t been perfect, but it’s helped guide our years. </h3>



<p>If something has remained on a list for multiple years, we re-evaluate the value we place on it. If something was really easy, I try to them add something a bit more challenging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of the exercise we usually have a good overview of things we want our next year to include.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_1808.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2818"/><figcaption>Reading great books</figcaption></figure>



<p>This past year was no different. We created our lists and I periodically checked in on it. Once an activity was completed, I’d color in the box and add details. In the past my goals have changed, but they typically include social/financial/creative/physical challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’d certainly challenge you to do this as well. It’s a little different than a resolution, since it’s more of a set of values and wishes. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5126.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2810"/><figcaption>I used my Cricut multiple times and made a fun hot air balloon shower gift for my cousin</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Even if you just look at it from time to time, it can guide your hopes and desires that God has laid on your heart for the new year. Ask Him what you should focus on and pair that with passions.&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Here’s Mine:&nbsp;</p>



<p>My 2019 Goals&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Isabella’s Baby Book&nbsp;</li><li>Become A Foster/Adopt Home&nbsp;</li><li>Make Shirts with my Cricut&nbsp;</li><li>Read through the Bible&nbsp;</li><li>Go on a Trip with Dust + Bella&nbsp;</li><li>Try A New Recipe with my Kitchenaid Mixer&nbsp;</li><li>Throw Bella a 1 Year Birthday Party&nbsp;</li><li>Give Back to ACH + RH&nbsp;</li><li>Write Bella’s Birth Story&nbsp;</li><li>Create Ireland Photobook&nbsp;</li></ol>

<h2>Some Notes About My 2019 Goals&nbsp;</h2>



<h2>Isabella’s Baby Book&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Completed September 2019</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0808.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2789"/><figcaption>I enjoyed working on it at a local coffee shop, Nickel and Bean </figcaption></figure>



<p>This was a challenging one. I had wanted to buy a baby book and work my way through it when Bella was born, but with her being 3 months early, a baby book just brought about bad memories. It took me awhile to find a good baby book that I liked and that I knew I could work through, with taking in account her prematurity. I searched and found a reasonable priced one. It took a lot of work to re-record memories, glue in photos, track down milestones, and open myself up to reliving some of the trauma of her NICU stay, but I did it! I’m very pleased I have a beautiful record of her first year (and will add to it) and it was worth the detail-work and effort.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Become a Foster/Adopt Home&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Completed February 5th&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2020.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2843"/><figcaption>Happy Family of 3&#8230;Wanting more in the future! </figcaption></figure>



<p>We began our foster/adopt journey a few years ago. We had begun classes and was close to entering into our certification. Having Bella messed up our schedule. But, what babies don’t?! In 2018 we did our home study. Hours and hours. On February 5th we officially got our paper certifying our home and us as foster parents. Although we’re not yet at a place to host a child long-term, we are on the list for respite care and hope to invest more time in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Make Shirts with my Cricut&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Completed Numerous Times!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5365.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2835"/><figcaption>Grandma T-shirt! </figcaption></figure>



<p>I received a Cricut Explore Air 2 for Christmas last year from my dad. My in-laws bought me lots of accessories, too. I began by making paper crafts and worked my way up to heat transfer vinyl. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_6297.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2832"/><figcaption>Disney world t-shirt for me and dress for Bella</figcaption></figure>



<p>This was fun and new and challenging! Since having Bella I haven’t had much time to myself…much less time to craft. For both Valentine’s Day and our Disney trip I made custom t-shirts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_3336.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2806"/><figcaption>Using my Cricut<br><br></figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5192.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2793"/><figcaption>Bonus! I was able to make decorations with my Cricut for a friends baby shower</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Read Through the Bible&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Not Completed, Begun</p>



<p>This was one of those goals that I knew was hefty. I wanted to be intentional though and worked my way through the Bible with the Bible app. I got quite a way through, but have more to go. I found that although it was good to read scripture through, I became bored at times and would switch it up with other studies. I still want to continue to read through the Bible completely, not just pick and choose the easy chapters. I plan on continuing the plan into 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Go On a Trip with Dust + Bella&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Completed May &amp; September&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20190524_112040641.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2826"/><figcaption>At a petting zoo in Berlin</figcaption></figure>



<p>This was an easy goal, but very much desired! Since having Bella, we hadn’t been able to go on a trip because of her feeding issues. We switched to bolus (syringe) feeds partnered with pump overnight feeds in the Spring. This allowed us so much more freedom!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MVIMG_20190524_112743452.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2814"/><figcaption>Bella&#8217;s not too crazy about the big cow</figcaption></figure>



<p>In May we went on our first overnight as a family. We rented this adorable “farmhouse” room in Amish Country. We took Bella all the places we loved in Berlin…the cheese barn, the lil bakery with yummy sandwiches, the puppy store, etc. It was a magical time. It re-ignited our passion for travel. It turned out little Bella was an expert traveler herself! She rolled with all the punches and loved being away (except at night when she landed in our King bed between us).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the Amish Country visit, I had more confidence and bravery to plan a 2 WEEK ROADTRIP to Florida. In September, we drove to Florida. We spent a week at Disney and a little over a week visiting family in Nokomis/Venice. It was truly special. Although we all got sick, I have happy memories from this first out-of-state road trip with my little family. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0088.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2808"/><figcaption>Meeting Mickey &amp; Minnie</figcaption></figure>



<p>Also, we got to stay in Gatlinburg and share the mountains with Bella. While in the high-risk unit, I would talk to her and visualize us taking her to the mountains. This gave us lots of hope and joy under scary circumstances. It felt like we’d come full circle when we arrived in the Smokey Mountains.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9776.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2831"/><figcaption>Florida Family</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Try A New Recipe with my Kitchenaid Mixer</h2>



<p>Completed January 20th&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_3674.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2834"/><figcaption>I love my mixer</figcaption></figure>



<p>I have this beautiful Kitchenaid Mixer. I used to use it a lot more before Bella. I love to bake and be in the kitchen. I loved making Starbuck’s copy cat banana bread. It was delicious!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_3681.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2791"/><figcaption>My banana bread</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Throw Bella a One Year Birthday Party&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Completed March 1st&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACS_0015.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2836"/><figcaption>Bella&#8217;s 1! </figcaption></figure>



<p>From the moment I got pregnant, I began dreaming up first birthday ideas. I love a good bash and the fact Bella was in isolation made a party that much scarier and sweeter! Even though she wasn’t to be out of isolation until May, we invited a ton of people and threw her a big party. Money was tight so we just had desserts but it was so fun. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5039.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2829" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/img_5039/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2829"/></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5043.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2815" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/img_5043/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2815"/></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_4950.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2813" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/img_4950/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2813"/></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACS_0018.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2805" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/acs_0018/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2805"/></figure></li></ul>



<p>I’ll never forget seeing so many people in our little home. There were cars parked all the way up/down the street to meet out miracle. Bella loved the attention and enjoyed opening her gifts. The theme was gold and floral. The same theme for her nursery.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Give Back to Ronald McDonald House and Akron Children’s Hospital&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Completed November&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0880.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2809"/><figcaption>Baskets made up </figcaption></figure>



<p>We were shown so much love and graciousness from RMH Akron and ACH. It had been our desire to give back in any way we could.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although we didn’t have much money, I spent time nominating our two primary nurses for the DAISY award. This award recognizes “Extraordinary Nurses”. It was with so much joy I learned they both received this special distinguished award this year.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7125.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2725"/><figcaption>Jackie &amp; Nicole, our DAISY Award Nurses</figcaption></figure>



<p>Once we were more financially stable, we created gift baskets for families at the Ronald McDonald House. While staying there we were given a few gift baskets/bags. It always meant so much to me since my love language is gift giving. It was a JOY to gather Christmas items to put in a fun gift basket for families.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0943.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2804"/><figcaption>Bella at Ronald McDonald House </figcaption></figure>



<p>We coordinated with friends from the NICU and brought Bella back to visit. We do this often while in Akron, but this past time was very special because a lot of NICU friends came out and visited. Bella ran up and down in the family visitor space. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0954.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2792" data-link="https://poeticlaughter.com/img_0954/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2792"/></figure></li></ul>



<p>Two years before, I sat eating Thai food at the table she ran by…unable to walk from an emergency c-section and wondering how my 1lb 7ounce baby would make it.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0941.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2787"/><figcaption>The Success Wall! </figcaption></figure>



<p>There was a “success” wall of children that had graduated the NICU. I would stare at it while waiting on laundry to be done. I memorized the faces and prayed that some day Bella could return and get a photo in front of that wall. I prayed for a testimony like theirs. My mom got a picture of us. Matching red outfits. So much joy.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0937.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2811"/><figcaption>So much joy~ </figcaption></figure>

<p>This isn’t done. For many reasons. Time, energy, thoughts, etc. I got very far in writing out our story one night. I cried. I prayed. I read over diary entries and looked at calendars marked with viability stats. I am 95% done. Maybe I like it unfinished. But, I’d like to complete it this year to testify God’s goodness…through all the hardships.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Create Ireland Photobook&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Completed November, Ordered January 2nd&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ok, so I technically completed “creating Ireland Photobook” before the New Year, but I ordered it on the 2nd using a Groupon! It was important to me to collect all of our favorite photos and put them in a tangible flip-through book. Travel is important to us, and surrounding ourselves with photos of trips we’ve taken helps us make the adventure last longer! It also puts the value of travel in front of us, inspiring us to save toward more trips.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_8478.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2842"/><figcaption>My first night away from Bella since being home from the NICU! Jonas Brothers concert with my mom and sister</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Notable Mentions&nbsp;</h2>



<p>I didn’t set out for these goals, but honestly they’re things I am so out-of-this-world proud of.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Losing 20lbs&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Mid October</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0295.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2820"/><figcaption>Optavia</figcaption></figure>



<p>I began trying to lose weight before Disney but never made it very far. I am addicted to sugar and struggle with overeating. I began Optavia and fell in LOVE with the program. After 3 months I am down 20lbs and am so very happy with my body. For the first time I am happy to say I lost weight in the past year!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Writing Professionally Again&nbsp;</h2>



<p>November&nbsp;</p>



<p>I didn’t set out to make money writing again. In fact, I don’t feel like I have much time! This post has taken a few different attempts. A friend needed someone to write a few articles for a local online news source. It was super cool and exciting. I have NEVER written for a news source. It was scary not knowing the ropes…but kinda cool too. I learned to write in a different style, interview contacts, and meet guidelines. I learned about local happenings and enjoyed a little bit of extra money.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Hosting a Girls Brunch&nbsp;</h2>



<p>December&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s always a reason to avoid having people over. For me, it’s been Bella. I decided to host a girls Christmas brunch. It was so much fun. My dad and his wife watched Bella and I had about 8-10 friends over for yummy food, drinks, crafts, and Christmas movies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I learned so much about this tradition. I embraced long days inside and warm, cozy, blankets. Hygge is the Danish/Norwegian word for a mood of coziness. I listened to&nbsp; “The Little Book of Hygge” while feeding Bella via pump for hours. I decorated with the things I had around the house or Goodwill candles. I rested. It was perfect for the stage of life we were in (in isolation) and is something I want to continue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there you have it. My 2019. I’d like to do separate posts about Bella’s milestones and my milestones for 2020. I wonder if I’ll find the time?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Love + Light, </p>

<p>You see, Bella was born a micropreemie. She weighed ONE pound and SEVEN ounces. That&#8217;s it. At first, you couldn&#8217;t notice the Hemangioma at all on her scalp, but as she grew, it grew too. I&#8217;ve written a long post about Hemangiomas and <a href="https://poeticlaughter.com/whats-on-her-head-a-hemangioma-story/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">what they are here</a>, but the short and sweet answer is this: </p>



<p>&#8220;A hemangioma (he-man-jee-O-muh) is a bright red birthmark that shows up at birth or in the first or second week of life. It looks like a rubbery bump and is made up of extra blood vessels in the skin.&#8221; Mayo Clinic </p>



<p>Bella had 6 at one point. They were all almost unnoticeable except the one on her scalp which grew aggressively once she was adjusted to a newborn. We eventually made the decision to treat it because it was threatening to break open and could get infected. Personally, I was a little relieved we treated it from a cosmetic standpoint, too. I was concerned she wouldn&#8217;t have hair growth where the Hemangioma was and I was also concerned about the long-term effects of the loose skin once it went back down in size. </p>



<p>The other 5 weren&#8217;t a problem and they were itty bitty red dots. There were 2 on her chest, 1 near her navel and 1 behind her ear. Since she had so many, the Pediatric Dermatologist ordered an ultrasound to rule out any internal ones. It was a frustrating process because something was detected on her liver&#8230;but 6 months later it was ruled as a misread and perhaps just a shadow. Those times of waiting were very stressful. </p>

<p>4 months ago we began to wean her off her medication. This was exciting, but scary! We had to do it very slowly since it was a medication that affected her blood pressure. Once she was off the medication, Propranolol, we waited. Although very rare, Hemangiomas can have some regrowth. Unfortunately Bella&#8217;s did. We called and re-started the medication for 6 weeks. We weaned again. Tediously, we prayed that the Hemangioma would stay down while we weaned slowly off the medication. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Montgomery36.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2778"/><figcaption>In the Spring, we took pictures for Mother&#8217;s Day! We were still on medication <br><br></figcaption></figure>



<p>Today, she&#8217;s been off the medicine for over 2 months! Sometimes it looks puffier, since she still has some blood vessels outside where the Hemangioma is, but mostly it has stayed down and almost flush with her scalp. </p>

<p>We are so thankful for Dr. Nguyen and his team at Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital. They walked us through each step and monitored Bella very closely when we began the medication. He answered all of our questions and was available any time we needed him! He even would message me back quickly and called us on his cellphone when the Hemangioma looked very bad. </p>



<p>We are so thankful it has gone down and isn&#8217;t a risk to her health! A few friends have said they love it, because it&#8217;s uniquely HER! I agree!  </p>

<p>I wanted to write this post to encourage anyone whose baby was born with Hemangiomas. I&#8217;m not an expert, but have been through it. I&#8217;m always happy to answer any questions! </p>



<p>Love and Light, </p>

<p>As soon as I found out I was expecting a baby I began pinning all different ideas to Pinterest. Regardless of the gender, I knew I</p>



<p>1.) Wanted the nursery to have a lot of white and neutrals in it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2.) Wanted to simplify the space and make it a relaxing oasis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3.) Wanted my amazing sister, Kayley, to sew a custom quilt for my little one.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8895.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2592" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8895.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8895-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8895-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<p>I had pinned ideas for both boys and girls. Later, once we found out we were expecting a sweet little girl, I zeroed in on different ideas. After a lot of thought and planning, Dustin and I decided to go with a simple, traditional nursery with gold, pink, and florals.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8897.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2594" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8897.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8897-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8897-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<p>Ideas that we decided against included: bohemian, Kate Spade, wooden &#8220;adventure&#8221;, and damask.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8896.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2593" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8896.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 660w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8896-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_8896-640x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<p>I don&#8217;t like a lot of clutter. I have anxiety and things thrown about can trigger stress for me. I like whites, clean lines, and lots of storage! I wanted the space to look like a baby&#8217;s room, but I also wanted the dresser and other large ticket items to grow with Isabella. I think that it&#8217;s important for kids to decorate their own space, but I know for now, the space is more for mommy and daddy, and not so much Bella, so we did what we would enjoy best.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It ended up amazing. The space is EXACTLY what I dreamed of. I think it has a lot of character and is classic, yet fun for a baby girl. In these picture we haven&#8217;t hung all the artwork on the walls yet, or accents (like above the crib), but you can see where it&#8217;s headed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will also be using this space in the future as we do foster/adopt. The space is Bella&#8217;s, but can also house another little one. With this thought in mind, we kept things like the crib neutral, in case Bella outgrows it and we are placed with a boy.</p>

<p>Above are the images that I pinned that really inspired me. I loved the idea of mixing florals with white and grays. Of course you always need a lil bling, so I worked in strategic gold accents.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Beginning Stages</h2>

<p>The process was&#8230;.a process! We used the room to store a lot of mix/match things until we had the time to get organized and make it ours. </p>

<p>We were so blessed by my sister, family, and friends with a lot of generous items for Bella. I ended up being hospitalized only 2 days after my shower, so we had to come back and re-organize it later. </p>

<p>Above, you can see we certainly organized and decorated in stages. Have your little one in the NICU for over 100 days makes it hard to finish a nursery. So many people helped us. We had such great support. <br></p>



<h2>It&#8217;s Finished. (Mostly) </h2>



<p>Today, almost 11 months after our emergency c-section and delivery 3 months early&#8230;the nursery is mostly DONE! Since Isabella has a gtube and other health concerns, she sleeps in our room, BUT, this space is heavenly. I walk in and touch everything. It smells so fresh and clean and baby-ish. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had this post in &#8220;draft&#8221; for so long! Today the room looks so different, but I wanted to post it anyway since it is so fun! </p>

<p>Honestly, it&#8217;s hard to imagine it&#8217;s taken so long to get these thoughts out of my head&#8230;but when you have a little one that has a lot of needs&#8230;heck&#8230;if you just have a little one&#8230;you get it. I&#8217;ve begun writing a post about Isabella&#8217;s &#8220;other 2 NICU moms&#8221; a thousand times but every time it just doesn&#8217;t seem to do them justice. So, with nurses week and Mother&#8217;s Day upon us and the fact that Bella is successfully napping in her crib, I thought I&#8217;d take a stab at it once more. </p>



<h2>How Do You Thank Someone Who Literally Sustains/Loves/Cares for Your Baby As Their Own?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7125.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2725"/><figcaption>She loves them..even though her face looks smug! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Candy, cards, mugs&#8230;these small gifts seem so humble compared to the immeasurable love and support Nicole and Jackie have given our family. Writing a quick Facebook post for Nurses Week also pales in comparison. You see, these two women, one my age, and one younger, literally acted as mothers to Bella while staying in the NICU for 3 1/2 months. Jackie and Nicole are among the brightest, most professional, kindest, calmest, amazing women/nurses/people you will ever meet. </p>



<h2>Jackie Taught Us Details</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7003.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2738"/><figcaption>Jackie helping us with Bella before discharge. </figcaption></figure>



<p>At only two days old, Jackie signed up to &#8220;primary&#8221; us. This means she choose to care for Isabella and our family when she was on her shift at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Before I even could hold my baby she was able to change her diapers, apply Aquaphor to her translucent skin, talk to her, and love her as an excellent nurse would. </p>



<p>You see, in many cases with preemies, the mom is unable to go with the baby to the NICU. In our case I had to stay behind at another hospital for 3 days and be monitored because of my health. While away, I missed out on precious moments with Bella and lived through snapshots on Dustin&#8217;s phone and stories from my family who were there to see her. </p>

<h4>All the while I was pumping/trying to pee without crying/learning to hobble around my room/etc. a woman that was a stranger had chosen to love our family and along with others was providing the best care I could possibly imagine for my 1 pound 7 ounce little girl. </h4>



<p>I didn&#8217;t even know her name. But a week after the delivery and the day (or 2 it blurs together) after we moved into Isabella&#8217;s private NICU room I found out she would be consistently caring for our sweet girl. </p>



<p>She has chosen us and I was honored that a nurse of her expertise in small babies would dedicate so much of her knowledge and energy to my newborn. But, honestly, I assumed she would give so much to little Bella. What I didn&#8217;t realize as how much she would give to ME.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7006.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2740"/><figcaption>Jackie encouraging Bella to pass her carseat test</figcaption></figure>



<p>Jackie is someone that pushes herself in everything she does. She is knowledgable, quick witted, kind, and to-the-point. Along with being a registered nurse, she strives to achieve other certifications, including Kangaroo Care! As I spent days learning to care for an extremely fragile infant, I got to know Jackie and learned a little bit about her and what made her passionate for the NICU. Her little brother had had cancer and although he had overcome it, the impact had weighed heavily on her. She strived to make an impact in other&#8217;s lives and ended up getting a position with the top NICU (where we were) and within the same hospital her little brother had been cared for years earlier. I loved her. </p>

<p>I loved talking with her and it was so refreshing to learn the best &#8220;do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts&#8221; within the NICU walls. The little room on the 7th floor holding that itty bitty baby became a sanctuary for me. As I asked questions, I began building my confidence as a mom. I learned what each number on the monitor meant and even how to attach the leads for Bella if they fell off (with the approval of the nurses). I memorized her schedule and even helped take her temperature or lower/raise her isolette.  Of course Jackie was a busy lady. She didn&#8217;t have a second to grab a bite to eat most shifts, (let alone play cards <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) and I would watch in shock as she ran back and forth between patient rooms and answered to patient calls. She was kind, yet confident and knew what needed to be done to achieve the best health for those babies. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_5416.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2742"/><figcaption>Jackie, teaching me to give Bella a &#8220;bath&#8221; </figcaption></figure>



<h4>Although we became friends, I always knew that her job as a nurse came first and she was so prompt and exact. I constantly was impressed by her professionalism and love for those babies. </h4>



<p>I remember vividly Jackie helping me with Bella&#8217;s feed through her OG (feeding tube through her mouth). We were discussing something and one of the rooms began to code. Minutes earlier the team making rounds had been in our room, going over Bella&#8217;s care, laughing at my jokes, and talking about local things to do. My heart always panicked when I&#8217;d hear our neighbors in trouble and I&#8217;d always sigh a sigh of relief it wasn&#8217;t Bella, but then push back tears for the other moms. Jackie stopped mid sentence and was laser focused. She ran (along with the other team members who had traveled to the next room) to the room where the alarm was going off. I could tell each and every team member was ready to save a life. Thankfully, this was a misunderstanding and a new parent or grandparent pushed the wrong call button. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_8986.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2724"/><figcaption>Jackie (pregnant) &amp; I post NICU </figcaption></figure>



<h4>Seeing this made me so confident that if something happened to our Bella, a nurse, just like Jackie, would come to her aid and put her safety as the top priority. </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_5661.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2743"/><figcaption>Practicing Kangaroo Care </figcaption></figure>



<p>For Jackie, her job is more than a job. When there were little ones whose families weren&#8217;t present she would spend extra time, making sure the baby was comforted. In those early days she advised me on how to do &#8220;skin to skin&#8221; and to bond with Isabella. As the weeks went on, she challenged me to be the very best mom I could be and reminded me that I was Isabella&#8217;s MOM, even though I had to have assistance to even get her out of her rainforst-like isolette. I couldn&#8217;t even touch her in ways that would cause her to be overstimulated. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_5678.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2745"/><figcaption>Bella wrapped in a fun bandana with cute sheets via Jackie </figcaption></figure>



<p>It was a hard place to be, but the encouragement from Jackie and the other nurses helped me to learn about my baby and her specific needs. For the first time I learned what the word &#8220;advocate&#8221; truly meant and I threw myself into reading all about the NICU and my daughters condition. Along the way I&#8217;d ask Jackie questions as she helped me change diapers, weigh poos/pees, get Bella&#8217;s temperature, or give her baths.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-178-819x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2203" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-178-819x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 819w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-178-240x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 240w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-178-768x961.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-178-640x801.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Simon-Says-Smile-178.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></figure>



<p>Jackie was the one who encouraged me to help give Bella her first &#8220;bath,&#8221; helped me hold her to my breast for stimulation, taught me all about the ABC&#8217;s of safe sleep, and reassured me that Bella was going to be great! Throughout the day/night/etc. Jackie was there in the background, cheering us on, teaching, and doing what she did best, caring for her patient, who happened to be less than 2 pounds. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_5591.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2744"/><figcaption>Jackie found a &#8220;dress&#8221; for Bella and matching sheets </figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the most thoughtful things Jackie did for Bella was make sure she got &#8220;cute&#8221; sheets for her isolette. The NICU uses pillow cases for the bedding and some are not as cute and fun as others. Jackie would always grab fun sheets that would make us smile. They helped brighten our day when things seemed dark and overwhelming. Jackie also purchased some cute Easter decor for our room and went out of her way to spoil us! Bella got many special gifts from her &#8220;primary&#8221; and we made sure to tell her all about Jackie and Nicole. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2215.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2604" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2215.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 650w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2215-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2215-640x854.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption>Practicing Safe Sleep! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course it was with great excitement and joy that I learned Jackie was expecting a baby while caring for ours in the NICU! I was proudly one of the earlier ones to know since she battled morning sickness and she wanted us to know she wasn&#8217;t ill! As time went on, I was moved when I&#8217;d see her holding Bella and know her little one would be here eventually. Funny enough, her son was the first &#8220;baby friend&#8221; Bella had! Months later, after we were discharged, we made frequent trips back to the hospital and visited with Jackie. She was a beautiful mom from the beginning to delivery and I was so impressed by her ability to continue to excel at her job. Jackie ended up having her son early and spent 18 days in the NICU herself. Her son is thriving and they are both doing great! I got to meet and hold him. The picture we have of us 4 is extremely special to me. </p>

<h2>Nicole Taught Us Fun </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_6592.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2733"/><figcaption>Giving Isabella a Bottle While I Learn! </figcaption></figure>



<p>When Bella was a month old we were transferred to a &#8220;step down&#8221; unit. It was still for babies needing extra care, but it wasn&#8217;t the less intense &#8220;feeder/grower&#8221; floor. I remember our items were moved while we were out to dinner. It was so strange to come back to a new room, but we were so excited to be in a new space AND we were more than accommodating for a baby more critical than Bella to use the coveted room feet away from the control room where all the specialists sat. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_6806.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2735"/><figcaption>Spoiling the Tiny Human with Owl Clothes </figcaption></figure>



<p>This new floor gave way for a new special friendship with Nicole. Jackie and Nicole, as I learned later, had primaried a baby before, taking turns to care for him on a regular basis. As a primary, a nurse gets to know a child that will be in a hospital setting for a long time. This is great for the child and parents because they have consistent care and an advocate who KNOWS the child in and out. If a child doesn&#8217;t have a family, a nurse can request to primary it. Jackie and Nicole had cared for a few babies who didn&#8217;t have families. They&#8217;d spend their own money for special clothing, Christmas gifts, or toys. They were the &#8220;moms&#8221; to these babies, who knew no one else! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_6593.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2732"/><figcaption>Nicole, rocking &#8220;Owl&#8221; scrubs with Bella </figcaption></figure>



<h4> In a lot of ways, Jackie and Nicole knew more about Bella than I did. At first that bothered me, but then later I was so relieved because I had not one, but TWO dynamite professionals cheering on my daughter and my family. This also meant I could learn about her care and help when needed. </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_6234.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2731"/><figcaption>A Onesie I Made For Bella to Wear </figcaption></figure>



<p>So, back to Nicole. Nicole is one of the chillest people you&#8217;ll ever meet. She&#8217;s laid back enough to feel relaxed around, but able to get the job (or in her case 1,000 jobs) done! She doesn&#8217;t drink coffee, which I found/find appalling, (haha) but is able to do all-nighters like nobody&#8217;s business. The first time I met Nicole I immediately had a girl crush. She was fun, outgoing, silly, attentive, and told me that the hospital cafeteria had these delicious &#8220;hollywood peanut butter chocolate squares&#8221; on Wednesdays. Her bright colors and love for owls drew me in. I wanted to have her care for Bella every day and smiled whenever I saw she&#8217;d be in. Soon enough, she actually signed up to primary us with Jackie. I was thrilled. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7049.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2734"/><figcaption>NICU Grad (Later was readmitted) </figcaption></figure>



<p>I told her it reminded me of dating. &#8220;I like her? Does she like us? Would she like to care for our family? What if she doesn&#8217;t like us or think that&#8217;s weird?&#8221; The love ended up being mutual and even after getting pooped on a lot, she still stuck it out with us. </p>



<p>With Nicole, we had her a lot during during late nights and before Bella was discharged. As she taught us to feed Bella, we had more time to talk and get to know one another. As the babies in the NICU become stronger, they need less and less attention from the nurses. Bella&#8217;s care went from 1:1, to 2:1, to 3:1, and even sometimes 4:1 if there was a gap in nursing shifts. This was a good thing that Bella needed less and less care, but it was harder and more isolating because you didn&#8217;t get to see a nurse as much. You learned to do a lot more as a parent, which is exactly what we wanted to do! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7051.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2727"/><figcaption>Owl Bottom </figcaption></figure>



<p>Nicole taught us to have fun. Although she was extremely thorough in Bella&#8217;s care (and ours), she always took a minute to laugh or give an extra snuggle. We adopted a lot of Nicole&#8217;s nicknames for Bella and use them to this day, like &#8220;Little Miss&#8221; and Dustin&#8217;s favorite from another NICU mom &#8220;Stinkerella.&#8221; Nicole and I connected on a personal level and I constantly had to keep myself from talking her ear off so she could do her job! She helped us learn about Bella&#8217;s unique personality. </p>



<p>It felt taboo sometimes to attribute characteristics or just play with Bella in the NICU. The first time I saw anyone ever just play with Bella was Nicole. She had her on her pulled up knees and was lightly touching her nose. She loved it! I sat shocked. Of course our baby could play, but I hadn&#8217;t really considered holding her normally, even though she was old enough. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_6848.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2737"/><figcaption>Happy with Nicole! </figcaption></figure>



<h4>I felt like everything we did had to have a specific &#8220;cause&#8221; or &#8220;medical outcome.&#8221; To just play and relax with our little blessing was surprisingly new to me. </h4>



<p>After watching Nicole, I learned how to &#8220;play&#8221; with Bella. I had always read to her, but for the first time I made extra silly faces and tried peek-a-boo. In some ways I think I just assumed Bella wouldn&#8217;t advance from that newborn/preemie/isolette stage. I hadn&#8217;t spent a lot of time considering her out of her isolette or in a home setting. Nicole helped me learn to imagine&#8230;FREEDOM. She spoke about the future and treated Bella as if she was a normal baby.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_5871.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2722"/><figcaption>Helping Dad Give Bella Her First &#8220;Tub&#8221; Bath </figcaption></figure>



<p>Nicole also shared a love for food. She liked sweets (like me) and we loved bringing donuts and Insomniac cookies when we could. I remember learning that she was the culprit for many of the babies signs on their doors. Each door had a fun sign with the babies name and other information. This made the NICU more fun! When I&#8217;d walk the halls late at night I&#8217;d read all the signs. It helped humanize these tiny babies. Seeing their names written in fun colors with markers was up lifting. </p>



<h4>It turns out Nicole had her own set of markers/supplies and would make signs for the babies without families. </h4>



<p>When I learned that there were many abandoned babies or babies without visitors I became very sad. Knowing that nurses like Nicole loved on those babies made me smile. Bella, of course, got lots of signs made from yours truly. Quotes, pictures, coloring sheets, etc. were plastered all over the door. It made me feel happy to bring beauty into her little space. Looking back, I spent a lot of time perfecting the decor in her private room. It was one of the few things I had control over and it brought me a lot of joy. I took a lot of pictures to remember those days. Thankfully, Nicole let me use her markers! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7043.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2721"/><figcaption>I loved seeing Nicole was our Nurse! </figcaption></figure>



<p>As the days went on and on and on, we began to think of Nicole as family. She&#8217;d watch Bella when we&#8217;d be out and near the end we began staying at the Ronald McDonald house and not in her room. Nicole and Jackie would leave us notes and I knew she was in good hands as they helped teach her to take bottles. Nicole rearranged her schedule just to be at Bella&#8217;s discharge. She helped us get her tiny little body in her carseat and celebrated every step out of the hospital walls. She shed tears with us and spoiled Bella with clothes and toys throughout her stay. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9563-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2739"/><figcaption>Cuddling with Bella OUTSIDE of the NICU! </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Continued Love, Fun Aunts</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1829-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2723"/><figcaption>Bella hanging with Nicole on Halloween! Post NICU </figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking back, what I didn&#8217;t know was that I would rely heavily on the strength and love Nicole and Jackie gave in the NICU. When you&#8217;re discharged you assume things will go smoothly. The worst is over. Unfortunately for us, a lot of trouble hit when we were discharged. Bella was readmitted within 3 days for an aspiration event and ended up needing a gastronomy tube. Later, she developed some severe health issues. </p>



<h4>With the love of these nurses and knowledge, I was able to advocate well for my daughter outside of the hospital walls and get her the care she deserved/deserves. </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4856.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2709"/><figcaption>Nicole, Me, and an ever-growing Bella! Lunch Post NICU </figcaption></figure>



<p>She is still unable to eat at 14 months, has undergone many tests, is on 3 different prescriptions, and has gained way too many diagnosis, but I learned the &#8220;ropes&#8221; in the NICU and recall what Nicole and Jackie taught me on a daily basis. </p>



<h4>Today, I don&#8217;t look as Jackie and Nicole as &#8220;Moms&#8221; to Bella anymore. </h4>



<p>I&#8217;ve taken over all of her care and wouldn&#8217;t want it any other way&#8230;but they still hold a very special place in our family and hearts. I like to think of them both as Aunts! We stay in touch with each and have now added them on social media at my request. They always &#8220;like&#8221; Bella&#8217;s pictures, write comments, and check-in on us. If I have questions I can ask them and they are always there as friends. Both have prayed for us and have become such great friends. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1679-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2746"/><figcaption>Easter 2019, A Year Later! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course it was a huge blessing when Nicole came to Bella&#8217;s first birthday party. She drove over 2hrs and celebrated with us! Jackie was busy being a momma to her little one but we saw her shortly after. Both nurses are still actively working in the NICU and loving others well. </p>



<p>When we met Nicole for lunch a few months ago I found myself feeling&#8230;jealous! I was jealous that she&#8217;d probably &#8220;moved on and had another primary family in the NICU&#8221;&#8230;it was such a funny feeling. I then reminded myself that it was AWESOME that she had more love to give and that we were good and in a different season. </p>



<p>Although I found slight jealousy that another family may be receiving this amazing love/care/professionalism from our nurses, I was overjoyed that they&#8217;re changing lives every day. </p>



<h4>And for me? I&#8217;ll just keep remembering them every Mother&#8217;s Day and trying to express my eternal gratitude for the time when they were both mother&#8217;s to my Isabella. </h4>

<p>Last week we had our well check up for Isabella. Our doctor, Dr. Burns with Akron Children&#8217;s Pediatrics shook his head and said, &#8220;She&#8217;s a miracle.&#8221; </p>

Modeling with a big bow and diaper. </figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s true. She is a miracle. She has come so stinking far. She amazes us every day. On the 1st she&#8217;ll be 11 months old. So very close to ONE YEAR.</p>



<p>We are very proud of her. Her strength and joy is contagious. </p>



<p>One of my favorite things to do is reflect on God&#8217;s mercy and grace. He has tossed buckets on us over the last year. </p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have a lot of time to write a full update, but I will say this:</p>



<p>Isabella is thriving. She is growing and is over 14 lbs. She is patient and always quick with a smile. She loves family and cuddles. She doesn&#8217;t love wearing hats and jumps at overly loud noises. Her grin and two little teeth make everyone smile. </p>



<p>Here are some pictures that we&#8217;ve collected this month&#8230;but first, a few of where she&#8217;s come from. </p>



<p>Below was the first time I touched her. She was a day old. Less than 1lb 7 ounces. </p>

<p>Hello All! It&#8217;s been a little bit! Instead of writing an update on Isabella, I thought I&#8217;d post about how our bedroom is set up for her and her feeding tube! Before we brought Bella home, I looked everywhere online and really only found a few resources for setting up a space for a gtube fed baby that I loved. I decided that having Bella and her equipment (even though it&#8217;s not a ton) could look stylish and neat in our space. So I&#8217;ve worked hard to find solutions that work for us. Of course, it&#8217;s taken a bit, but this is what we&#8217;ve come up with!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1638.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2545" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1638.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1091w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1638-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1638-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1638-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1638-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1091px) 100vw, 1091px" /><figcaption>Our bed! We invested in a Sleep Number Bed and adore it! </figcaption></figure>



<p>She&#8217;s napping beside me right now&#8230;so I might have to make this shorter than I&#8217;d like. When she wakes up, we&#8217;ll have to play!</p>



<p>For context: Isabella is 9 months old and has a gtube. Her gtube is a Minnie One Button by AMT. She is on continuous overnight feeds. She just recently outgrew her bassinet (she&#8217;s 12 1/2 lbs and it holds up to 15 but she&#8217;s rolling). She&#8217;s itty bitty thanks to being a micropreemie and having feeding difficulties!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Isabella&#8217;s Clothing&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Babies with Gtubes may need to be &#8220;hooked up&#8221; all night. We primarily use button down sleepers. We run her tubing through the space between the buttons. Of course, sometimes I love a zipped up sleeper OR we purchased them before we knew she&#8217;d have a Gtube (darn my need to be &#8220;prepared&#8221;). In this case, I take scissors (fabric ones work best) and cut a slit near the leg. If the sleeper zips down instead of up (like in this picture above) we can run the tubing out the bottom before zipping it all the way! It&#8217;s also interesting to note that Gtube babies can leak. Their stoma (hole in their stomach) leaks and sometimes gets stomach stuff on their clothes or you or their bed. In this case, Bella&#8217;s gtube leakage stained her sleeper. The acid in the stomach contents basically &#8220;bleaches&#8221; it. See the right side?</p>



<p>In some cases a baby may need to have gloves to cover their hands from grabbing their tubing. Bella got too smart and pulls her gloves off. We love the sleepers that have built in mittens. She has more trouble pulling them off. But, they aren&#8217;t readily available in larger sizes. I&#8217;ll have to make a post all about the best clothing for tubies later!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1636.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2543" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1636.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1091w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1636-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1636-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1636-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1636-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1091px) 100vw, 1091px" /><figcaption>Our room with Bella&#8217;s set up </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Our Room Setup</h2>



<p>Our home has only 2 bedrooms. It&#8217;s a small cape cod style brick home. We set up a lovely nursery for Isabella, assuming she would spend time in the other bedroom. Instead, we have Bella in our room out of necessity and love it! (I would strongly suggest sharing a room with your baby as long as you can. Some of the most precious moments have taken place in this little room. Lots of memories).</p>



<h2>Why Does She Need to Be In Our Bedroom?</h2>



<p><strong>1.) A &amp; B&#8217;s</strong> </p>



<p>Isabella has a lot of health concerns. When we brought her home from the NICU she slept in our room because she had had A &amp; B&#8217;s (apnea and bradycardia, pauses in breathing and lower heart rates) before being discharged from the NICU and we weren&#8217;t comfortable having her sleep away from us. She was clear of them, or else she wouldn&#8217;t have been able to go home, but we were still a little bit weary of them. 100+ days in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit does that to you.</p>



<p><strong>2.) AC</strong> </p>



<p>Our home also doesn&#8217;t have central air so we would have her stay in our space with the air running. </p>



<p><strong>3.) Overnight Feeds</strong> </p>



<p>Until Bella was over 6 months old we were on a strict 3 hour schedule. When she was about 7 months we went to a 4 hour schedule. Then, around 8 months we switched to overnight continuous feeds.</p>



<p>Before switching to overnight feeds, Bella would be sleeping, then we&#8217;d get her up and she&#8217;d need to be hooked up to her pump and would eat for an hour and then be held for at least 30 minutes afterward or she would vomit. We would pause the feed if she retched and sometimes held her for two hours or longer. This was very tiring. We fed her 10:30pm 1:30am, 4:30am, and 7:30am. Then, we graduated to 11pm, 3am and 7am. You can imagine how much that helped us! Then we switched to continuous feeds which is a win win for everyone! </p>



<p>During the night feeds it was easiest to just have Bella close-by. We took turns doing the feeds while sitting upright in bed. We&#8217;d watch movies on our phones, play games, or read. Eventually we&#8217;d get so tired that we&#8217;d bring ice packs to bed to keep us from nodding off. We could&#8217;t fall asleep while holding Bella for fear she&#8217;d suffocate or aspirate. We both got used to sleeping with the lights on and lots of noise! </p>



<p><strong>4.) Aspirating &amp; Choking </strong></p>



<p>At one point, Bella was vomiting up to 6-7 times a night. We would hear her begin to choke and would run to her bassinet to help her clear her throat. This was terrifying as we practiced safe sleep and she&#8217;d be on her back. We got used to her sounds and could tell when she was coughing or about to vomit. We had extra bedding/clothing/etc. If she were in another room we wouldn&#8217;t be able to hear her and risk not getting to her in time and her aspirating her vomit. We would also switch our clothing sometimes up to 4 times a night since she&#8217;d vomit on us. </p>



<p><strong>5.) Continuous Overnight Feeds</strong></p>



<p>Now, some of the previous concerns aren&#8217;t as prevalent. I no longer worry about A &amp; B&#8217;s now that she&#8217;s almost 9 months and it&#8217;s the winter so air conditioning isn&#8217;t a concern. </p>



<p>We do worry about her choking and aspirating. Although she can clear her throat on her own, we worry she will fall back asleep in her vomit or swallow it wrong. </p>



<p>She is also now getting continuously fed by her Kangaroo Pump. We need to be able to hear if it alerts us to an empty bag or clog. We do wake up 2x a night to refill the formula, change her diaper, and give her a medication. She can go all night without vomiting, but usually vomits at least once during the night (which we hear). </p>



<h2>The Crib</h2>

<p>We moved my makeup vanity to make room for Isabella&#8217;s crib. The crib is just basic white and works great. We didn&#8217;t have a lot of room in the space so we actually have it covering my closet. We simply scoot it over if I need in it, which I don&#8217;t very often since most of my cozy clothes are in drawers. My dad gifted it to us for around $200 and it converts to a toddler bed and headboard. We use a Abbot Safety Crib Mattress with a waterproof mattress cover. Bella&#8217;s sheets need changed a lot throughout the night. We use basic gray fitted sheets we were gifted from Target. The fun ruffle is from Amazon, but we removed it because the kitties were enjoying hanging out under the crib during the day. </p>



<h2>Storage Solutions</h2>



<p>We found early on that we needed A LOT of storage for Bella. </p>



<h2>Diaper Caddies Are My BFF </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1615.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2531" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1615.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1091w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1615-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1615-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1615-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1615-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1091px) 100vw, 1091px" /><figcaption>Diaper Caddy Above
</figcaption></figure>



<p>To begin, I created a fun little diaper caddy for upstairs and downstairs. This diaper caddy was a big lifeline and helped me stay organized! I found two gray caddies with plenty of storage from Amazon. Both are almost identical, expect the bedroom one used to have some topical medicines Bella needed at night.</p>



<p>The caddy is packed (and re-stocked as needed) with the basics: diapers, wipes, hand sanitizer, and anything else we might need. </p>

</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>On the sides I pack:</p>



<p>-Topical Medications </p>



<p>For Bella we have one for her Hemangioma and one for her Gtube site. I wouldn&#8217;t ever put oral medications out for safety reasons, especially as she gets older and can reach into the caddy. </p>



<p>-Split Sponges </p>



<p>These go around her Gtube site and keep it dry and clean. We usually use sterile ones that we open as needed. We also have made our own with cosmetic sponges. </p>



<p>-Boogy Wipes</p>



<p>Saline solution wipes to soften boogers (haven&#8217;t needed them!) </p>



<p>-Honest Company Lavender Lotion</p>



<p>My all time favorite baby product ever. I love this stuff and use it on Bella after baths, before bed and on myself! </p>



<p>-Medical Tape </p>



<p>We don&#8217;t use this a ton, but sometimes need it to secure her tubing or her stoma site. It also comes in handy to manipulate the tubing and move it away from her. </p>



<p>-Digital Thermometer </p>



<p>Once a NICU mom, always a NICU mom. She had her temp taken every 3hrs. I don&#8217;t obsessively check it, but it&#8217;s there if I need it. </p>



<p>-Teether/Toys</p>



<p>Sometimes you need to be able to grab a toy real quick to distract or soothe a baby! </p>



<p>-Warm Socks</p>



<p>Bella always would choke herself with her hands when she was younger. She&#8217;d gag and then throw up! We would put socks over her hands as mittens because we went through so many. She&#8217;d throw up on them constantly. So an extra pair served us well. For a long time she&#8217;d grab her tubing, but she&#8217;s getting better about it. The socks on her hands also kept her from grabbing her tubing or the med port attached to the tubing. </p>



<p>-Sanitizer </p>



<p>Would you want your diaper changed and then your mommy feeding you without washing her hands? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We sanitize like it&#8217;s our business. I&#8217;ll change her diaper then give her meds or hook her up to the feed. I use sanitizer in between. </p>



<p>I really can&#8217;t say enough about this caddy solution. It&#8217;s awesome. Everyone who helps with Bella knows the caddy has everything you need. I keep it stocked and ready. Some items have been added, others subtracted. Usually there&#8217;s a burp cloth thrown on top for emergency spit ups. At the bottom you might find chapstick or a favorite hand lotion for me. I also attach those little sanitizers to the handles to guarantee there&#8217;s always sanitizer close by. </p>



<p>Things that have been subtracted: mittens, gauze pads, cotton swabs, gtube cleaning kits, homemade diaper cream, and water wipes.</p>



<p>Things that have been added: cotten swabs, a nose frieda sucker, saline spray for the nose, assorted toys, and a notepad and pen (to write symptoms, important numbers, etc) </p>



<h2>Makeup Drawer Conversion (ALEX Drawer from IKEA) </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1607.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2524" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1607.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1607-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Alex drawers</figcaption></figure>



<p>You might know from this blog, but before Bella, I enjoyed writing about makeup and beauty products! I have quite the collection (err hoard) of makeup products. Having a baby changes from things and I don&#8217;t add much to my collection these days. I do, however, have an awesome storage drawer set for my things! I kept it in tact as long as I could until Bella&#8217;s things overflowed into it. I actually still have my makeup, beauty supplies, and jewelry in it, but have made room for some Bella essentials. (My vanity is now in her room where I get ready and she also has lots of storage in her room.) These items are only essentials and things we need to grab during the night or morning. However, I could see where if you needed the space for other medical items or general baby items you could put them in the drawers. This would be great for a baby with a vent! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1610.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2527" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1610.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1610-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>My makeup! </figcaption></figure>



<p>I still have my makeup in the drawers, but have cleared 3 for Bella&#8217;s things. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1609.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2526" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1609.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1609-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Sleepers</figcaption></figure>



<p>We go through SO MANY sleepers since she vomits quite a bit. And sometimes her gtube leaks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1608.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2525" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1608.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1608-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Burp Cloths</figcaption></figure>



<p>We also go through about 6 or more burp cloths a day. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1611.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2528" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1611.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1611-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Socks and Makeup! </figcaption></figure>



<p>I juusssttt added a small space for her socks. We noticed we always put them on at night or before her days so I threw them in here. There&#8217;s also a few mittens in there. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1614.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2530" data-link="http://poeticlaughter.com/img_1614/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2530" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1614.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1614-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Items in the diaper caddy
</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1613.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" data-id="2529" data-link="http://poeticlaughter.com/img_1613/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" class="wp-image-2529" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1613.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1613-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Storage behind the caddy</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>Lastly, I place the diaper caddy on top of the drawers and use the space behind it to hide a few things! We always keep extra sanitizer, sanitizing wipes, a blanket or changing pad to change her on, and a few favorite toys. </p>



<p>I&#8217;ve thought about putting pull out drawers under her crib, but I just run into her bedroom to grab her outfits which are hung up in the morning. So there really isn&#8217;t a need. We put extra sheets for her crib in the Alex drawers as well. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1634.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2541" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1634.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1634-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Fun pillows! </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Our Monitor </h2>



<p>As Bella gets bigger, we have the option of leaving her in her crib sometimes without us in the room. I can only count the time we&#8217;ve done this on one hand, but it&#8217;s a nice option. To be honest, Dustin wakes up and goes to work in his office. I keep sleeping in the room with Bella. He brings our monitor with him and is able to listen and see Bella even though I&#8217;m in the room. We mounted our monitor right above her crib so we can see her completely. We absolutely love it. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1556-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2518" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1556-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1556-1-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Watching from above</figcaption></figure>



<p>We bought the Levana monitor from Khols with some Khols cash that was given to us. I love it. I don&#8217;t remember the model. It tells us the time, temperature in the room, and is both color and has great night vision. You can also talk to the baby through it, walkie-talkie style! </p>



<p>When Bella vomits in the morning after Dustin goes downstairs he can hear her and see us. If I need assistance getting her cleaned up, or catching the vomit, or changing the bedding, he can run up the stairs in a minute. (He works from home). This is great since sometimes I&#8217;m a little groggy from just waking up and it&#8217;s good to have an extra set of hands. We can also communicate back and forth. He can hear us and we can hear him. Sometimes he can see her grabbing her tube and making a fuss. Sometimes he hears her coughing before she throws up. It&#8217;s nice to have him &#8220;watching us.&#8221; He laughs that he can hear me snoring and can tell if we&#8217;re both still asleep! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1627.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2539" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1627.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1091w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1627-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1627-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1627-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1627-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1091px) 100vw, 1091px" /><figcaption>Bella&#8217;s view

<h2>Crib Accessories</h2>



<p>We don&#8217;t keep much of anything in Bella&#8217;s crib. I was hesitant about the fish electronic toy, but she used it in the NICU and loved it. We have the one with a remote control. We only set it to &#8220;waves&#8221; at night as a sound maker. She&#8217;s learned to kick it on with the orange button, which is pretty fun. It&#8217;s also nice for her to see when I&#8217;m tidying up the bedroom and restocking her diaper caddy or getting ready in the morning. I would never have a toy in her crib while she&#8217;s sleeping, but if I&#8217;m watching I let her have one or two if I&#8217;m in the room. </p>



<h2>Trash</h2>



<p>We have both a small trash can and a diaper genie. (Both need taking out in this picture). The diaper genie works great and we use it for heavier diapers. The small trash can is used for gauze, tubie covers, medical tape, and wipes. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1626.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2538" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1626.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1091w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1626-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1626-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1626-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1626-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1091px) 100vw, 1091px" /><figcaption>Another view of our room</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1628.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2540" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1628.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1628-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Keeping it real<br></figcaption></figure>



<p>You may see these pictures and think things are too &#8220;staged.&#8221; Well, they are. Although this is how our room looks most days, I do utilize a few tricks to make it look nice. I always stash un-folded laundry on the other side of the bed! I also have a fun robot vacuum and use it in the bedroom from time to time. I try to keep handy storage solutions close so that everything has it&#8217;s own place. That helps because otherwise I feel stressed. Every night before bed we tidy up and every morning I try to make the bed. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>



<p>Also, you may* have noticed my bra hanging on the closet door lol. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1557.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2519" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1557.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1557-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>View from my bed at night</figcaption></figure>



<p>The only thing that is different when Bella is eating/sleeping is her IV pole and pump! We bring it up at nighttime. This is what the set up looks like. If you hate light, you&#8217;ll want to tape a black piece of paper over the pump face. We don&#8217;t mind it. I actually like the glow and pumping noise! </p>



<h2>A Unique Use of Paper Towel Rolls </h2>



<p>Last, but not least, I do worry about Bella getting strangled by her feeding pump tubing. It&#8217;s long. And it worries me. We looked online and our best solution is running it through empty paper towel rolls. Our perfect number is 3! She is unable to wrap it around her neck this way. She does grab them and sometimes puts the tubing in her mouth. For the most part she doesn&#8217;t. The pump will also alert us if there is a clog, so if it was being wound tight around her it&#8217;d alarm us. She usually sleeps very well and only grabs the tubing when she&#8217;s ready to wake up and get our attention! She&#8217;s never pulled her tube out on her own, but had kicked the medical port open once. That&#8217;s for another time. </p>



<p>I hope this is helpful for any other tubie mom who wants their space to look nice! </p>

<p>I wanted to give a quick update on Bella and life. Unfortunately I usually end up writing way too much and over-sharing. For that reason, you can scroll to the bottom of this post for a TLDR (Too Long Didn&#8217;t Read) summary.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Bella&#8217;s Milestones</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2130.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2509" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2130.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2130-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Rolling back and forth</figcaption></figure>



<p>Isabella is doing quite a bit! I have to remind myself that she is only 5 1/2 months adjusted and not the technical 8 1/2 months she is. She loves to coo and make lots of noise. She mimics us and my sister Kayley actually taught her to curl her tongue the other day! I didn&#8217;t believe it until she was doing it the next day on her own! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1742.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2478" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1742.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1091w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1742-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1742-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1742-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1742-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1091px) 100vw, 1091px" /><figcaption>Loving with Daddy</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bella can&#8217;t sit up on her own, but enjoys her sit-me-up-chair and rolls around quite a bit. She doesn&#8217;t love flipping all the way over and settles for just rocking side to side.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2070.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2501" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2070.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2070-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Cuddling </figcaption></figure>



<p>She doesn&#8217;t like tummy time, but we are trying to sneak it in every day. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s because of her gtube or if the pressure makes her vomiting worse.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1920.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2484" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1920.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1920-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Hanging with dad</figcaption></figure>



<p>A new special love is books! Bella loves to flip the pages and look at the bright colors. She enjoys listening to others tell stories. She especially loves visitors of all kinds. Grandma Julie and Grandma Kim are over a lot and spoil her with lots of attention and play time. She is reaching for toys and pulling hair (ouch!). We are excited as she grows and hope she will be sitting up on her own.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1934.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2490" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1934.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1934-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Enjoying a &#8220;Girls Bible&#8221; </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Bella&#8217;s Size&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Little itty bitty Bella is still tiny. She&#8217;s in the less than 1% for her age, but we think she&#8217;s just extra teeny and cute! A good friend found this adorable art piece that fits her perfectly. (Thank you Zara, Alex and Alex!) Even though Bella is 8 1/2 months, she is just under 12lbs. She wears size 1 in diapers and also wears 3 months in clothing.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2042.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2499" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2042.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2042-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Cute diapers from a friend! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Her size isn&#8217;t a big concern currently because her rate of growth is getting better. For once, our dietician seemed pleased with her growth! She averages less than 15 grams a day. Of course they&#8217;d like to see her hit 30 grams a day, but she likes to do things her way.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2128.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2508" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2128.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2128-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Doing things her way! </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Eating&#8230;Starting Baby Food!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2037.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2497" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2037.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2037-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>What is this?</figcaption></figure>



<p>We got the green light just Tuesday to begin trying baby food with Isabella! I rebelled and had bought a small jar of Beechnut baby food to try. (Silly me, I didn&#8217;t realize a blend wasn&#8217;t the best choice until later). Thankfully she seemed to tolerate it. This will be a long process since Bella has such a strong eating aversion. We are excited to begin working with her and will be allowing her to try fruits and vegetables that are thicker to prevent her from aspiration.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2039.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2498" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2039.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2039-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Bellas first oral try of food </figcaption></figure>



<p>Our GI Dietician suggested allowing her to be in control during the feeds. We will allow her to hold the spoon and/or reach for the food. We have to be very careful as to not irritate her or bring back scary memories from when she was silently aspirating and we didn&#8217;t know it. Our goal is for her to just tolerate oral feeds. She hasn&#8217;t had anything orally since we left the NICU in June after her feeding tube was placed.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2013.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2494" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2013.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2013-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>&#8220;Eating&#8221; with Daddy</figcaption></figure>



<p>For fun, and curiosity sake, I offered her a bottle a few times last week. She had no idea what to do with it. BUT she did reach for it and didn&#8217;t cry or knock it our of my hands. She held it and chewed on the nipple. She never latched, but seemed ok with just gumming the nipple. I emptied the rest into her feeding tube bag and let her get comfortable with it. We will go straight to a sippy cup because of her eating issues.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1926.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2486" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1926.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1926-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Oh&#8230;I remember these</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Vomiting&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Bella continues to vomit, but it is getting better. She is doing overnight feeds which are amazing and allow her to get more in her tummy without gagging. She is also taking medications and seeing our local chiropractor, Dr. Matt Beachy. We have seen a huge improvement in her overall health since starting overnight feeds and seeing Dr. Beachy. Bella still vomits 3X or more times a day, but it is much more manageable than 8x!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2106.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2503" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2106.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2106-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>At Akron Children&#8217;s meeting with her Dietician</figcaption></figure>



<p>We have noticed other benefits like increased energy, the ability to burp without throwing up, and hair growth!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Synagis Shots to Prevent RSV&nbsp;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1861.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2480" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1861.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1091w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1861-300x225.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 300w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1861-768x576.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 768w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1861-1024x768.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1024w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1861-640x480.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1091px) 100vw, 1091px" /><figcaption>My dining table looks like a doctor&#8217;s office! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Bella gets these crazy expensive shots once a month. It&#8217;s called Synagis and it&#8217;s basically antibodies injected into her to help her fight RSV. It&#8217;s surprisingly not a vaccine. Only certain babies that are high risk qualify. The home health nurse comes and gives it to her in the thigh. Thus far we&#8217;ve had one injection for November. It&#8217;s a very interesting process.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2022.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2495" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2022.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2022-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Medical supply monthly delivery</figcaption></figure>



<p>This also means that we have chosen to mostly isolate Bella to home. We have only taken her to the Grandparents and her appointments. We have limited visitors. When we do go out ourselves we change our clothes and sanitize like crazy. Long story short, Bella has a weaker immune system. She needs protected as a micropreemie and we are making this a priority. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1738-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2477" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1738-1.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1738-1-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Not so bad at home&#8230;with a fun candle insert my daddy got us! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Bella did get a small virus, but was able to fight it off, almost completely. She is a little congested still but nothing bad. The doctors at Akron Children&#8217;s Pediatrics made an emergency appointment and assessed her. They suggested she fight it off herself and not to give her medications, which made me happy. She had a runny nose, slight cough (which sounded like a barking seal), and low fever. I believe I gave it to her. She seems almost over it. We also had her tested for RSV to rule it out. She didn&#8217;t have it. The doctors are amazing and the one we saw called us that night at 9pm to confirm she was RSV free!</p>

<h2>Mourning A Loss</h2>



<p>Unexpectedly we found out one of my friends, Elizabeth Brown, committed suicide less than a week ago. Elizabeth was a great friend and I grew up with her and her brother. This loss has really hit us hard and we are grieving. As a mother, I now experience this loss in a new light. My heart is broken for her husband, her family, and friends. This has certainly made me think about life and hug those around me a little longer. I&#8217;ve also been feeling a little gloomy, which is to be expected. </p>

<p>I will miss this special friend and am preparing for her memorial service. My little sister, Kayley, and her were like sisters and she will be speaking. </p>

<h2>God&#8217;s Love &amp; Friends</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1720.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2476" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1720.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1720-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Bella approves of Sara&#8217;s scripture cards! </figcaption></figure>



<p>In the midst of a hard week. Things seemed to get harder. We are getting hit with quite a few medical bills (go figure). We were denied help because of how much Dustin makes. This had us quite upset and racking our brains for some solutions. (We are very blessed to have solutions). Anyway, yesterday the financial people called and we were able to get an adjusted monthly minimum based on extenuating circumstances. Praise God! But, for awhile we were sweating it out a bit. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1938.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="" class="wp-image-2491" srcset="https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1938.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 614w, https://poeticlaughter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1938-225x300.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 225w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>Me time in the morning! </figcaption></figure>



<p>In the midst of this, some friends really blessed us and went above and beyond. A friend delivered a card and a white rose in honor of Elizabeth and my step-sister and her family sent us a beautiful card and adorable Dinosaur outfit! It was also so funny because Dustin went to buy me these beautiful parenting scripture cards from Sara Vrooman (a friend who has an etsy shop) and someone had already purchased them for me! My cousin Sarah had them mailed to me! These have helped me reflect on God&#8217;s love and promises. </p>

<p>These things helped remind me that we are loved. We aren&#8217;t isolated (even in &#8220;isolation&#8221;) and God is bigger than our circumstances. The day the rose was dropped off I had been really sad and was thinking about Elizabeth. Today, when we opened the adorable outfit for Bella we had just gotten home from taking her for a shot, which is always no fun. </p>

<p>Thank you so much Rebekah, Sarah &amp; family, and Anna, Danny, and Ev for the sweet reminder that others care. </p>

<p>Life is slow and fast right now. Each day I wake up to this beautiful, smart, fun, little human in my room. I get to snuggle with her on the couch and see family. Even though she has a feeding tube and some health concerns, life is good. </p>

<p>She is growing at her own rate and hitting milestones. She has been sick but overcame it! We are looking forward to introducing baby foods and enjoying the holidays. </p>

<p>Today Bella got to see snow for the first time (from the window). She looked surprised at how bright the outside world looked. I looked at her and was so excited over how bright her future is. Even in the midst of heartache and hurts we will keep looking for the silver lining. We will keep pushing forward and living for those teeny tiny small special moments&#8230;what other way is there?</p>
