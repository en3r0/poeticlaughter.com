Thanks so much Natalie! I really appreciate it when people take the time to comment and interact. I&#039;m just beginning, as you can tell, so it&#039;s really cool to meet people from all over the internet. Hoping to have another giveaway in the future!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a person who enters giveaways, this post was quite interesting to me. Even though I didn&#039;t win, I want to thank-you for being honest, transparent, and generous with your giveaway. In the end, I found a new blog to follow in my favorite category. :)]]></description>
