					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://poeticlaughter.com/a-long-day-without-many-answers/#comment-1033&quot;&gt;Patty Reppart&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Patty! Thanks for the comment. I believe they did rule it out because they did an Upper GI scan. Now we are turning our sights to her stomach and doing a gastro emptying test to see how long it takes for her tummy to empty! We certainly know she has immature muscles, and I&#039;ve asked about surgery, but our doctors have encouraged us to rule out and try all other methods to bring relief since the surgery is irreversible. :( I&#039;m so sorry it went on for 18 months! That seems like an eternity. Isabella has a feeding tube and there are a lot of things at play. I can&#039;t imagine struggling with this for over a year. The specialists are working with us to find a good solution. She is currently on a new formula that is easier to digest and is showing a lot of improvement!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Have the doctors ruled out her Pyloric?   Our son had ejectile vomiting from that and should have had surgery but it wasn&#039;t known back in 1966 when he was born.  I worked for a general surgeon who did the repair of the Pyloric muscle to fix that. Had we known about it when our son needed it , we would have been all for it.  He would just finish a meal/bottle and it was like a well let loose. That went on for almost 18 months. He did get a little better as he got older but always would gag easy.]]></description>
