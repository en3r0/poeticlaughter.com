		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] The new mascara from Benefit came out in late February and I ordered it from Sephora! I&#8217;ve used it a number of times and love the way it curls my lashes. The jury is still out whether I like it more than They&#8217;re Real Mascara, but we shall see. Stay tuned for a full review with pictures! [&#8230;]]]></description>
